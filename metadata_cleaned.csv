Viruses have been considered to be likely candidates since the recognition of the association between intrauterine rubella and congenital heart disease. Although the pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects is poorly understood, information gained from the study of congenital rubella syndrome suggests that mechanisms such as focal endothelial cell damage, resulting in obliteration of vascular supply, decreased growth rate, and shortened survival time of certain cells, and disturbed DNA replication in cells whose chromosomes were damaged secondary to the effects of virus replication may be operative in the production of defects in the developing fetus. In addition to rubella there is suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that Coxsackie B3 and B4 virus infections during pregnancy can result in the birth of infants with a variety of types of congenital heart lesions and that intrauterine mumps virus infection may be etiologically related to the postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Although there are a number of other viruses that are potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease, the current status of information is inadequate to allow even suggestive associations to be made. The most profitable areas for future investigation appear to be: (1) the epidemiology of congenital heart disease, (2) prospective studies of the association of maternal viral infection with abnormal offspring, (3) the in-depth virologic investigation of the infant with a cardiac defect, and (4) the development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease. Successful control of virus-induced congenital heart disease will depend on the results of these investigations and the development of vaccines against the identified causative viruses and/or safe and effective antiviral chemotherapy for the woman in early gestation who is infected with a known teratogenic agent.",12/31/1972,"Overall, James C.",American Heart Journal,,,FALSE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-8703(72)90077-4

It is estimated that each adult in the United States experiences two to four respiratory infections annually. The morbidity of these infections is measured by an estimated 75 million physician visits per year, almost 150 million days lost from work, and more than $10 billion In costs for medical care. Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome Is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently Identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionelia pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chiamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonlas are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents Including Leglonella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens. Given the diversity of pathogenic agents, it has become imperative for clinicians to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis before initiating therapy or to consider the diagnostic possibilities and treat with antimicrobial agents that are effective against the most likely pathogens.",6/28/1985,"Garibaldi, Richard A.",The American Journal of Medicine,,,FALSE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9343(85)90361-4

New etiologic agents, mechanisms, and diseases have become known. For example, Escherichia coli serogroup 0157 is now known to cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. Also, E. coli serogroups that produce Shiga toxin are recognized as etiologic agents in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described in stages: (1) adherence to epithelial cell microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with pill; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithelial cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections.

Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation. A major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role.

It is characterized by persistent cough and sputum production and is occasionally accompanied by fever and/or chest pain. Acute bronchitis may have a viral or bacterial origin and is often treated with antibiotics. Four clinical trials were conducted to compare high and low doses of loracarbef, a new oral β-lactam antibiotic, with three agents commonly used to treat acute bronchitis: amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, and amoxicillin. Results of these studies indicated that loracarbef, 400 and 200 mg twice daily, had clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against the common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis that was comparable with that of the comparative agents.

Conditions were optimized for resolution and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites of LA, one of which has not been reported previously as a metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. These products, 12-(ω)-hydroxy-LA, 11-(ω-1)-hydroxy-LA, and a novel metabolite, 10-(ω-2)-hydroxy-LA, were isolated by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, the formation of all three metabolites was linear with time and microsomal protein concentration. Hydrogen peroxide also supported the microsomal metabolism of LA, although the ratio of metabolites was substantially different than that produced by NADPH-supported microsomes. Several biochemical probes (metyrapone, α-naphthoflavone, 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride, and 10-undecynoic acid) were used to dissociate the three LA hydroxylase activities. These experiments suggest that the site-specific hydroxylation [ω-, (ω-1)-, (ω-2)-] of LA may be catalyzed by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450.",4/30/1988,"Romano, Maria C.; Straub, Kenneth M.; Yodis, Lee Ann P.; Eckardt, Regina D.; Newton, John F.",Analytical Biochemistry,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(88)90093-0

In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H+ e− ratio) of 0.66 ± 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+ e− ratio decreased to 0.280 ± 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons.",10/31/1991,"Prochaska, Lawrence J.; Wilson, Kathryn S.",Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-9861(91)90605-i

Infection of untreated A/J animals and vehicle controls with MHV3 resulted in marked and reproducible activation of peritoneal macrophages, observed in vitro as resistance to MHV3-cytopathic effects 48 hr after rechallenge with the virus, whereas exposure to dieldrin resulted in apparent loss of the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict replication of MHV3 and to protect them from cytolysis. In addition, in vitro treatment of MHV3 virus-activated macrophages with dieldrin, mitomycin C and X-irradiation, inhibited the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict MHV3 replication.

The HAG derivatives [RCHNNHC(NH)NHOH-tosylate] studied could be grouped as; (1) hydroxy-benzylidines; (2) methoxybenzylidines; and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2′-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 ± 5 and 13 ± 4 μM for 50% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy- and trihy-droxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGs were as active as the monohy-droxybenzylidene-HAGs. 2′-Hydroxy-4′-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2′,4′-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG. The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitro-benzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2′,3′,4′- and 3′,4′,5′-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 μM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 μM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 μM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2′,3′,4′-trihy-droxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 μM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [3H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 μM for 50% inhibition respectively).

In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I50 = 89 μm) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (I50 = 7.9 μM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxylalkyl and phosphoryl inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with I50 values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I50 = 1.6 μM), zofenoprilat (I50 = 7.0 μM) and YS 980 (I50 = 17.7 μM). Neither AP-A nor AP-N were affected by these sulphydryl compounds. Inhibition of AP-W may account for some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors. The availability of compounds which are totally selective for AP-W over any of the other mammalian cell surface zinc aminopeptidases may aid in identifying endogenous substrates, and thus physiological or pathophysiological role(s) of AP-W.",11/3/1992,"Tieku, Stephen; Hooper, Nigel M.",Biochemical Pharmacology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-2952(92)90065-q

Fast transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein arriving at the optic nerve terminals (superior colliculus) of the SFV-infected mice prior to the onset of demyelination. In contrast, the slow transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein at the superior colliculus of the SFV-infected mice during the demyelination period. There was no concomitant increase in labelled protein in the retina at any time after the SFV infection.

Treatment with12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused cultured astrocytes to proliferate. This effect of TPA was blocked by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C in astrocyte proliferation. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation, enhanced both the normal and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Authentic prostaglandin E2 blocked this effect of indomethacin and also partially blocked the effect of TPA, suggesting that the intracellular mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-regulated astrocyte growth might differ from those acting in protein kinase-dependent growth. The effect of prostaglandin E2 was blocked by a specific anti-prostaglandin E2 polyclonal antibody. Cultured astrocytes and microglia produced and released prostaglandin E2 in response to stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, TPA, and lymphokines. Since the sensitivity of astrocytes and microglia to these stimuli was different, prostaglandin E2 may differentially regulate astrocyte proliferation under different physiological conditions, acting in an autocrine fashion for astrocytes and in a paracrine fashion for microglia.",6/4/1993,"Sawada, Makoto; Suzumura, Akio; Ohno, Kazushige; Marunouchi, Tohru",Brain Research,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(93)90455-v

As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA.",6/6/1994,"Lavi, Ehud; Wang, Qian; Stieber, Anna; Gonatas, Nicholas K.",Brain Research,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(94)91327-7

GM-CSF induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by microglia, but not by astrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by bioassay and the detection of IL-6 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. GM-CSF did not induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a or IL-1 in microglia and astrocytes, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced all these cytokines.

Purified viral particles were spherical in shape and measured 90 nm in average diameter in negatively stained preparations. Pleomorphic forms were also present. The virions had envelopes with petal-shaped projections characteristic of coronaviruses. In ultrathin sections, cores in viral factories were round with a diameter of 50–60 nm. Most of these cores were electron dense but some had an electron-lucent center. In cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, and on the apical plasmalemma of intestinal epithelial cells, the virions were round or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring 70–80 nm in diameter, and had fine thread-like projections on their surfaces. Uptake of virus occurred through fusion of viral envelopes with the plasmalemma of the microvillous border or by entry into intercellular spaces and interaction with the lateral cell membranes of adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. As a result of this interaction, the lateral cell membranes became altered and ill-defined. During the early stage of infection, the rough andasmooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum became distended with electron-dense granulofibrillar material. This material accumulated subsequently as well-defined, smooth membrane-bound areas mainly in the apical cytoplasm of infected cells. These structures were considered to be viral factories. The morphogenesis of virus occurred mainly through condensation of the electron-dense, granulo-fibrillar material into viral cores in cytoplasmic viral factories or within the distended cisternes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Viral envelopment occurred on membranes of cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, or in association with membranes of viral factories. Release of virus from infected cells occurred by lysis and fragmentation of the apical plasmalemma and flow of the cytoplasm with its contents into the gut lumen.

In the present work, bovine and rat rhodopsin were analysed biochemically for the presence of a third sugar, galactose. Treatment of bovine rod outer segments (ROS) with galactose oxidase followed by reduction with tritium-labeled sodium borohydride revealed the presence of existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin. Rats injected intravitreally with [3H]galactose and [14C]leucine and maintained in darkness were killed 1 hr, 6 hr, 1, 3, or 5 days following the injection. Retinas were collected for subcellular fractionation and rhodopsin from each of the fractions was purified by ConA sepharose chromatography and SDS-PAGE. During the first 6 hr, galactose selectively labeled rhodopsin in the Golgi-enriched fraction resulting in increased [3H] [14C] ratios in both Golgi and ROS. The data suggested that trimming was occurring at the transition from Golgi to ROS. Furthermore, a decrease in isotope ratio in the ROS between 6 hr and 1 day suggested further trimming of rhodopsin after membrane assembly in the ROS. Additional in vivo experiments demonstrated existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chain using lectin affinity chromatography. Rats injected intravitreally with [35S]methionine were dark-adapted for 2 hr. Following subcellular fractionation of retinas, ConA purified rhodopsin from ROS was applied to one of two additional lectin columns: Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) or Griffonia simplicifolia I (GSA). Eight to nine per cent of the labeled rhodopsin was bound to and eluted from RCA, whereas none bound to GSA, indicating the presence of a β-galactoside. The RCA agarose eluted protein co-electrophoresed with a rhodopsin standard and was light sensitive. Galactose was shown to be the terminal sugar on this subset of rhodopsin and was not capped by neuraminic acid. Binding of rhodopsin's oligosaccharide to RCA was abolished by pre-treatment with β-galactosidase. Decreased binding of rhodopsin to RCA was observed following intravitreal injection of castanospermine but not swainsonine. Of those two inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming, only castanospermine would be expected to prevent the addition of galactose to the oligosaccharide. The association of galactose with rat rhodopsin appeared to be a transient one. At 2 hr, 8–9% of rhodopsin contained galactose, at 6 hr only 2·2% had galactose and by 24 hr less than 1% did. The galactose was trimmed from rhodopsin's oligosaccharide presumably after its role was complete. Separation of rhodopsin of the plasma membranes from rhodopsin of discs indicated that 75% of the galactose-containing rhodopsin was in the plasma membrane and only 25% was in the discs. These findings suggested a possible role for galactose in new disc formation with subsequent removal after the discs are sealed.",10/31/1991,"Smith, Sylvia B.; St Jules, Robert S.; O'Brien, Paul J.",Experimental Eye Research,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-4835(91)90170-j

Daily recordings, 7 h in duration, were made from each piglet beginning 3 days after surgery. Characteristic migrating motility complexes and short, distinct (2.5–5.0 s), rapidly aboral migrating bursts of intense spike activity (“migrating action potential complexes”) were seen in all preinfection recordings. Piglets were inoculated with a 1-ml oral dose of a 0.1% gut suspension from coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis) infected pigs. This resulted in inappetence, vomiting, and diarrhea, most marked on the second day postinfection, but which had abated by the third day. When compared to recordings from both fed and fasted noninfected (control) animals, infection significantly altered jejunal myoelectrical activity by (a) shortening the duration of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and prolonging it on day 2, (b) increasing the number of abnormal activity fronts, and (c) decreasing the number of migrating action potential complexes. Slow wave frequency and the duration of phase 3 of the migrating motility complex were unaffected. When compared to fed control animals, infected piglets also showed a slight shortening of phase 1 of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and a prolongation on days 2 and 3, as well as a shortening of phase 2 on the second and third days postinfection. Changes in myoelectrical activity were not solely due to decreases in food intake, as abnormalities persisted when food intake returned to normal on postinfection day 3, and disruption of the activity front and migrating motility complex duration were purely transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-induced phenomena.

All foals had maternal antibodies detectable by ELISA and IFAT, and seroconversion took place between the 2nd and 5th month of age. The 48 and 50 kDa antigens were recognized first in the course of infection.

From this, B. caballi antigens were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) and used as ELISA antigens. A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELISA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot.

The T strain of the virus caused only mild respiratory signs in both Rhode Island Red (RIR) and White Leghorn (WL) breeds; the 50 per cent mortality induced was due to acute nephritis. All the infected birds developed high titres of antibody to IBV for up to 30 weeks. In spite of the persistence of antibody, about 35 per cent of the RIR developed chronic progressive nephritis. The histology showed varying degrees of pathological changes in the tubules, with relatively unaffected glomeruli. Foci of mononuclear cell infiltration were prominent in the cortex and medulla, particularly in chronic nephritis. Cytoplasmic IBV immunofluorescence was found in all segments of the tubules, but not in the glomeruli. There was no evidence of virus replication in the caecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius. Evidence of extensive coronavirus replication was found in the cells of the tubules.

All mice inoculated i.c. with a large dose of virus died regardless of age, although a smaller dose caused fatal infection only in suckling mice. By intranasal, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation, the virus also killed suckling mice under 16 days old, but not older mice, even with a large dose. The susceptibility of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes.

Calves were monitored from days 1 to 5, and on day 6 (neonates) or 8 (weanlings) and, in a second trial at day 4·5, by histology, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and virus isolation. Mucosal lesions of neonates were similar to, but less extensive than, those of weanling calves. Loss of microvilli and goblet cells, with minimal epithelial erosions as early as day 1, progressed to necrosis of epithelium and adjacent lymphoid tissue, and leucocyte exudation. Lesions and clinical disease were progressive up to and including day 6 in neonates, but resolving in weanlings on days 5 and 8. By transmission electron microscopy, the physical characteristics of the phagocytic cells appeared similar in both age groups, and viral replication was not identified in leucocytes. Virus was isolated from, or found by immunocytochemistry in, the pharyngeal tonsil of all calves examined, except for two weanlings on days 1 and 8. Virus as detected by immunocytochemistry was restricted to epithelium and superficial lymphoid tissue in neonates, but was found in deep lymphoid tissue around germinal centres in weanlings. The study showed that the pharyngeal tonsil is readily infected with BHV-1 and may be an important lymphoid tissue for early anti-viral responses.

Enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with ELISASPOT (using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen) and ELISA tests respectively, according to the Ig isotype. The results showed a close relationship between ASC numbers and secreted antibody titres. The best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period. Antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak, with a maximum occuring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the IgA response appearing earlier than the IgG.

Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a “log-odds” matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated.

The signal is comprised of two elements, a heptanucleotide “slip-site” and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the pseudoknot and its contribution to the frameshift process by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of pseudoknot mutants. Our results show that the pseudoknot structure closely resembles that which can be predicted from current building rules, although base-pair formation at the region where the two pseudoknot stems are thought to stack co-axially is not a pre-requisite for efficient frameshifting. The stems, however, must be in close proximity to generate a functional structure. In general, the removal of a single base-pair contact in either stem is sufficient to reduce or abolish frameshifting. No primary sequence determinants in the stems or loops appear to be involved in the frameshift process; as long as the overall structure is maintained, frameshifting is highly efficient. Thus, small insertions into the pseudoknot loops and a deletion in loop 2 that reduced its length to the predicted functional minimum did not influence frameshifting. However, a large insertion (467 nucleotides) into loop 2 abolished frameshifting. A simple stem-loop structure with a base-paired stem of the same length and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot could not functionally replace the pseudoknot, suggesting that some particular conformational feature of the pseudoknot determines its ability to promote frameshifting.",8/20/1991,"Brierley, Ian; Rolley, Nicola J.; Jenner, Alison J.; Inglis, Stephen C.",Journal of Molecular Biology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(91)90361-9

We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in IBV was at the heptanucleotide stretch UUUAAAC, and then used our knowledge of the pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the −1 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a −2 +1 frameshift product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2% to 21%). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RNA pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all those known or suspected to be utilized in vivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and U are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage ( XXX YYYN) although C triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXY YYY N), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYY N ) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for A-site codons. These observations lead us to suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least in part, by the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs with the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized “shifty” tRNAs.",9/20/1992,"Brierley, Ian; Jenner, Alison J.; Inglis, Stephen C.",Journal of Molecular Biology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(92)90901-u
