Viruses have been considered to be likely candidates since the recognition of the association between intrauterine rubella and congenital heart disease. Although the pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects is poorly understood, information gained from the study of congenital rubella syndrome suggests that mechanisms such as focal endothelial cell damage, resulting in obliteration of vascular supply, decreased growth rate, and shortened survival time of certain cells, and disturbed DNA replication in cells whose chromosomes were damaged secondary to the effects of virus replication may be operative in the production of defects in the developing fetus. In addition to rubella there is suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that Coxsackie B3 and B4 virus infections during pregnancy can result in the birth of infants with a variety of types of congenital heart lesions and that intrauterine mumps virus infection may be etiologically related to the postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Although there are a number of other viruses that are potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease, the current status of information is inadequate to allow even suggestive associations to be made. The most profitable areas for future investigation appear to be: (1) the epidemiology of congenital heart disease, (2) prospective studies of the association of maternal viral infection with abnormal offspring, (3) the in-depth virologic investigation of the infant with a cardiac defect, and (4) the development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease. Successful control of virus-induced congenital heart disease will depend on the results of these investigations and the development of vaccines against the identified causative viruses and/or safe and effective antiviral chemotherapy for the woman in early gestation who is infected with a known teratogenic agent.",12/31/1972,"Overall, James C.",American Heart Journal,,,FALSE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-8703(72)90077-4

It is estimated that each adult in the United States experiences two to four respiratory infections annually. The morbidity of these infections is measured by an estimated 75 million physician visits per year, almost 150 million days lost from work, and more than $10 billion In costs for medical care. Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome Is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently Identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionelia pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chiamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonlas are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents Including Leglonella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens. Given the diversity of pathogenic agents, it has become imperative for clinicians to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis before initiating therapy or to consider the diagnostic possibilities and treat with antimicrobial agents that are effective against the most likely pathogens.",6/28/1985,"Garibaldi, Richard A.",The American Journal of Medicine,,,FALSE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9343(85)90361-4

New etiologic agents, mechanisms, and diseases have become known. For example, Escherichia coli serogroup 0157 is now known to cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. Also, E. coli serogroups that produce Shiga toxin are recognized as etiologic agents in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described in stages: (1) adherence to epithelial cell microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with pill; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithelial cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections.

Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation. A major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role.

It is characterized by persistent cough and sputum production and is occasionally accompanied by fever and/or chest pain. Acute bronchitis may have a viral or bacterial origin and is often treated with antibiotics. Four clinical trials were conducted to compare high and low doses of loracarbef, a new oral β-lactam antibiotic, with three agents commonly used to treat acute bronchitis: amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, and amoxicillin. Results of these studies indicated that loracarbef, 400 and 200 mg twice daily, had clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against the common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis that was comparable with that of the comparative agents.

Conditions were optimized for resolution and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites of LA, one of which has not been reported previously as a metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. These products, 12-(ω)-hydroxy-LA, 11-(ω-1)-hydroxy-LA, and a novel metabolite, 10-(ω-2)-hydroxy-LA, were isolated by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, the formation of all three metabolites was linear with time and microsomal protein concentration. Hydrogen peroxide also supported the microsomal metabolism of LA, although the ratio of metabolites was substantially different than that produced by NADPH-supported microsomes. Several biochemical probes (metyrapone, α-naphthoflavone, 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride, and 10-undecynoic acid) were used to dissociate the three LA hydroxylase activities. These experiments suggest that the site-specific hydroxylation [ω-, (ω-1)-, (ω-2)-] of LA may be catalyzed by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450.",4/30/1988,"Romano, Maria C.; Straub, Kenneth M.; Yodis, Lee Ann P.; Eckardt, Regina D.; Newton, John F.",Analytical Biochemistry,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(88)90093-0

In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H+ e− ratio) of 0.66 ± 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+ e− ratio decreased to 0.280 ± 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons.",10/31/1991,"Prochaska, Lawrence J.; Wilson, Kathryn S.",Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-9861(91)90605-i

Infection of untreated A/J animals and vehicle controls with MHV3 resulted in marked and reproducible activation of peritoneal macrophages, observed in vitro as resistance to MHV3-cytopathic effects 48 hr after rechallenge with the virus, whereas exposure to dieldrin resulted in apparent loss of the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict replication of MHV3 and to protect them from cytolysis. In addition, in vitro treatment of MHV3 virus-activated macrophages with dieldrin, mitomycin C and X-irradiation, inhibited the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict MHV3 replication.

The HAG derivatives [RCHNNHC(NH)NHOH-tosylate] studied could be grouped as; (1) hydroxy-benzylidines; (2) methoxybenzylidines; and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2′-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 ± 5 and 13 ± 4 μM for 50% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy- and trihy-droxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGs were as active as the monohy-droxybenzylidene-HAGs. 2′-Hydroxy-4′-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2′,4′-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG. The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitro-benzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2′,3′,4′- and 3′,4′,5′-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 μM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 μM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 μM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2′,3′,4′-trihy-droxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 μM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [3H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 μM for 50% inhibition respectively).

In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I50 = 89 μm) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (I50 = 7.9 μM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxylalkyl and phosphoryl inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with I50 values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I50 = 1.6 μM), zofenoprilat (I50 = 7.0 μM) and YS 980 (I50 = 17.7 μM). Neither AP-A nor AP-N were affected by these sulphydryl compounds. Inhibition of AP-W may account for some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors. The availability of compounds which are totally selective for AP-W over any of the other mammalian cell surface zinc aminopeptidases may aid in identifying endogenous substrates, and thus physiological or pathophysiological role(s) of AP-W.",11/3/1992,"Tieku, Stephen; Hooper, Nigel M.",Biochemical Pharmacology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-2952(92)90065-q

Fast transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein arriving at the optic nerve terminals (superior colliculus) of the SFV-infected mice prior to the onset of demyelination. In contrast, the slow transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein at the superior colliculus of the SFV-infected mice during the demyelination period. There was no concomitant increase in labelled protein in the retina at any time after the SFV infection.

Treatment with12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused cultured astrocytes to proliferate. This effect of TPA was blocked by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C in astrocyte proliferation. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation, enhanced both the normal and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Authentic prostaglandin E2 blocked this effect of indomethacin and also partially blocked the effect of TPA, suggesting that the intracellular mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-regulated astrocyte growth might differ from those acting in protein kinase-dependent growth. The effect of prostaglandin E2 was blocked by a specific anti-prostaglandin E2 polyclonal antibody. Cultured astrocytes and microglia produced and released prostaglandin E2 in response to stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, TPA, and lymphokines. Since the sensitivity of astrocytes and microglia to these stimuli was different, prostaglandin E2 may differentially regulate astrocyte proliferation under different physiological conditions, acting in an autocrine fashion for astrocytes and in a paracrine fashion for microglia.",6/4/1993,"Sawada, Makoto; Suzumura, Akio; Ohno, Kazushige; Marunouchi, Tohru",Brain Research,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(93)90455-v

As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA.",6/6/1994,"Lavi, Ehud; Wang, Qian; Stieber, Anna; Gonatas, Nicholas K.",Brain Research,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(94)91327-7

GM-CSF induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by microglia, but not by astrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by bioassay and the detection of IL-6 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. GM-CSF did not induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a or IL-1 in microglia and astrocytes, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced all these cytokines.

Purified viral particles were spherical in shape and measured 90 nm in average diameter in negatively stained preparations. Pleomorphic forms were also present. The virions had envelopes with petal-shaped projections characteristic of coronaviruses. In ultrathin sections, cores in viral factories were round with a diameter of 50–60 nm. Most of these cores were electron dense but some had an electron-lucent center. In cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, and on the apical plasmalemma of intestinal epithelial cells, the virions were round or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring 70–80 nm in diameter, and had fine thread-like projections on their surfaces. Uptake of virus occurred through fusion of viral envelopes with the plasmalemma of the microvillous border or by entry into intercellular spaces and interaction with the lateral cell membranes of adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. As a result of this interaction, the lateral cell membranes became altered and ill-defined. During the early stage of infection, the rough andasmooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum became distended with electron-dense granulofibrillar material. This material accumulated subsequently as well-defined, smooth membrane-bound areas mainly in the apical cytoplasm of infected cells. These structures were considered to be viral factories. The morphogenesis of virus occurred mainly through condensation of the electron-dense, granulo-fibrillar material into viral cores in cytoplasmic viral factories or within the distended cisternes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Viral envelopment occurred on membranes of cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, or in association with membranes of viral factories. Release of virus from infected cells occurred by lysis and fragmentation of the apical plasmalemma and flow of the cytoplasm with its contents into the gut lumen.

In the present work, bovine and rat rhodopsin were analysed biochemically for the presence of a third sugar, galactose. Treatment of bovine rod outer segments (ROS) with galactose oxidase followed by reduction with tritium-labeled sodium borohydride revealed the presence of existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin. Rats injected intravitreally with [3H]galactose and [14C]leucine and maintained in darkness were killed 1 hr, 6 hr, 1, 3, or 5 days following the injection. Retinas were collected for subcellular fractionation and rhodopsin from each of the fractions was purified by ConA sepharose chromatography and SDS-PAGE. During the first 6 hr, galactose selectively labeled rhodopsin in the Golgi-enriched fraction resulting in increased [3H] [14C] ratios in both Golgi and ROS. The data suggested that trimming was occurring at the transition from Golgi to ROS. Furthermore, a decrease in isotope ratio in the ROS between 6 hr and 1 day suggested further trimming of rhodopsin after membrane assembly in the ROS. Additional in vivo experiments demonstrated existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chain using lectin affinity chromatography. Rats injected intravitreally with [35S]methionine were dark-adapted for 2 hr. Following subcellular fractionation of retinas, ConA purified rhodopsin from ROS was applied to one of two additional lectin columns: Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) or Griffonia simplicifolia I (GSA). Eight to nine per cent of the labeled rhodopsin was bound to and eluted from RCA, whereas none bound to GSA, indicating the presence of a β-galactoside. The RCA agarose eluted protein co-electrophoresed with a rhodopsin standard and was light sensitive. Galactose was shown to be the terminal sugar on this subset of rhodopsin and was not capped by neuraminic acid. Binding of rhodopsin's oligosaccharide to RCA was abolished by pre-treatment with β-galactosidase. Decreased binding of rhodopsin to RCA was observed following intravitreal injection of castanospermine but not swainsonine. Of those two inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming, only castanospermine would be expected to prevent the addition of galactose to the oligosaccharide. The association of galactose with rat rhodopsin appeared to be a transient one. At 2 hr, 8–9% of rhodopsin contained galactose, at 6 hr only 2·2% had galactose and by 24 hr less than 1% did. The galactose was trimmed from rhodopsin's oligosaccharide presumably after its role was complete. Separation of rhodopsin of the plasma membranes from rhodopsin of discs indicated that 75% of the galactose-containing rhodopsin was in the plasma membrane and only 25% was in the discs. These findings suggested a possible role for galactose in new disc formation with subsequent removal after the discs are sealed.",10/31/1991,"Smith, Sylvia B.; St Jules, Robert S.; O'Brien, Paul J.",Experimental Eye Research,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-4835(91)90170-j

In the first few weeks after nerve lesions we observed a gradual increase in the number of Ia-immunoreactive cells starting with an initial appearance of Ia-positive perivascular cells which were succeeded by increasing numbers of Ia-positive ramified microglia. In long-term animals Ia expression was almost exclusively found in microglia.

Daily recordings, 7 h in duration, were made from each piglet beginning 3 days after surgery. Characteristic migrating motility complexes and short, distinct (2.5–5.0 s), rapidly aboral migrating bursts of intense spike activity (“migrating action potential complexes”) were seen in all preinfection recordings. Piglets were inoculated with a 1-ml oral dose of a 0.1% gut suspension from coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis) infected pigs. This resulted in inappetence, vomiting, and diarrhea, most marked on the second day postinfection, but which had abated by the third day. When compared to recordings from both fed and fasted noninfected (control) animals, infection significantly altered jejunal myoelectrical activity by (a) shortening the duration of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and prolonging it on day 2, (b) increasing the number of abnormal activity fronts, and (c) decreasing the number of migrating action potential complexes. Slow wave frequency and the duration of phase 3 of the migrating motility complex were unaffected. When compared to fed control animals, infected piglets also showed a slight shortening of phase 1 of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and a prolongation on days 2 and 3, as well as a shortening of phase 2 on the second and third days postinfection. Changes in myoelectrical activity were not solely due to decreases in food intake, as abnormalities persisted when food intake returned to normal on postinfection day 3, and disruption of the activity front and migrating motility complex duration were purely transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-induced phenomena.

The objective of this study was to search for likely microbial agents in diseased tissues using immunocytochemical techniques. Methods Intestines and mesenteric lymph node specimens of 21 patients from two French families with a high frequency of Crohn's disease and from Connecticut were studied. The microbial agents searched for included Bacteroides vulgatus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Escherichia coil, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus spp., bovine viral diarrhea virus, influenza A virus, measles virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Results Seventy-five percent of the patients with Crohn's disease (12 of 16) were positively labeled with the antibody to Listeria. Macrophages and giant cells immunolabeled for this antigen were distributed underneath ulcers, along fissures, around abscesses, within the lamina propria, in granulomas, and in the germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes.

From this, B. caballi antigens were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) and used as ELISA antigens. A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELISA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot.

The T strain of the virus caused only mild respiratory signs in both Rhode Island Red (RIR) and White Leghorn (WL) breeds; the 50 per cent mortality induced was due to acute nephritis. All the infected birds developed high titres of antibody to IBV for up to 30 weeks. In spite of the persistence of antibody, about 35 per cent of the RIR developed chronic progressive nephritis. The histology showed varying degrees of pathological changes in the tubules, with relatively unaffected glomeruli. Foci of mononuclear cell infiltration were prominent in the cortex and medulla, particularly in chronic nephritis. Cytoplasmic IBV immunofluorescence was found in all segments of the tubules, but not in the glomeruli. There was no evidence of virus replication in the caecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius. Evidence of extensive coronavirus replication was found in the cells of the tubules.

All mice inoculated i.c. with a large dose of virus died regardless of age, although a smaller dose caused fatal infection only in suckling mice. By intranasal, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation, the virus also killed suckling mice under 16 days old, but not older mice, even with a large dose. The susceptibility of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes.

Calves were monitored from days 1 to 5, and on day 6 (neonates) or 8 (weanlings) and, in a second trial at day 4·5, by histology, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and virus isolation. Mucosal lesions of neonates were similar to, but less extensive than, those of weanling calves. Loss of microvilli and goblet cells, with minimal epithelial erosions as early as day 1, progressed to necrosis of epithelium and adjacent lymphoid tissue, and leucocyte exudation. Lesions and clinical disease were progressive up to and including day 6 in neonates, but resolving in weanlings on days 5 and 8. By transmission electron microscopy, the physical characteristics of the phagocytic cells appeared similar in both age groups, and viral replication was not identified in leucocytes. Virus was isolated from, or found by immunocytochemistry in, the pharyngeal tonsil of all calves examined, except for two weanlings on days 1 and 8. Virus as detected by immunocytochemistry was restricted to epithelium and superficial lymphoid tissue in neonates, but was found in deep lymphoid tissue around germinal centres in weanlings. The study showed that the pharyngeal tonsil is readily infected with BHV-1 and may be an important lymphoid tissue for early anti-viral responses.

MCAs were obtained which react specifically with IgG, IgG1, IgG2 or IgA while MCAs against IgM showed a partial cross-reaction with affinity purified IgA. MCAs with optimal characteristics for application in ELISA were selected and used as conjugates in an indirect double antibody sandwich assay (IDAS) and as the capturing antibody in an antibody capture assay (ACA) for the isotype-specific detection of antibodies against rotavirus. Based on theoretical grounds, experimental analysis of inter- and intra-isotype competition in IDAS and ACA, respectively, and direct comparison of both tests, the IDAS was selected for the detection of IgG1 and IgG2 anti-rotavirus antibodies.

Enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with ELISASPOT (using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen) and ELISA tests respectively, according to the Ig isotype. The results showed a close relationship between ASC numbers and secreted antibody titres. The best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period. Antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak, with a maximum occuring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the IgA response appearing earlier than the IgG.

Local alignments are frequently constructed with the aid of a “substitution score matrix” that specifies a score for aligning each pair of amino acid residues. Over the years, many different substitution matrices have been proposed, based on a wide variety of rationales. Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a “log-odds” matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated.

The signal is comprised of two elements, a heptanucleotide “slip-site” and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the pseudoknot and its contribution to the frameshift process by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of pseudoknot mutants. Our results show that the pseudoknot structure closely resembles that which can be predicted from current building rules, although base-pair formation at the region where the two pseudoknot stems are thought to stack co-axially is not a pre-requisite for efficient frameshifting. The stems, however, must be in close proximity to generate a functional structure. In general, the removal of a single base-pair contact in either stem is sufficient to reduce or abolish frameshifting. No primary sequence determinants in the stems or loops appear to be involved in the frameshift process; as long as the overall structure is maintained, frameshifting is highly efficient. Thus, small insertions into the pseudoknot loops and a deletion in loop 2 that reduced its length to the predicted functional minimum did not influence frameshifting. However, a large insertion (467 nucleotides) into loop 2 abolished frameshifting.

We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in IBV was at the heptanucleotide stretch UUUAAAC, and then used our knowledge of the pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the −1 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a −2 +1 frameshift product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2% to 21%). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RNA pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all those known or suspected to be utilized in vivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and U are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage ( XXX YYYN) although C triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXY YYY N), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYY N ) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for A-site codons. These observations lead us to suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least in part, by the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs with the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized “shifty” tRNAs.",9/20/1992,"Brierley, Ian; Jenner, Alison J.; Inglis, Stephen C.",Journal of Molecular Biology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(92)90901-u

The agent has been attenuated by serial passage in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. When attenuated virus is inoculated in 8-week-old C3HeJ mice a myelopathy of delayed onset with prominent demyelination of lateral and anterior columns occurs. The DA virus is believed to be related to the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (TME) viruses because of the similar clinical and pathological conditions which it causes, and because neutralization tests indicate shared antigens between it and GD7, a TME virus. This paper reports electron-microscopic studies of BHK-21 cells infected with DA virus. The cells were prepared 24 and 48 hr after inoculation. Cytopathic effects were observed and infected cells contained plaques consisting of numerous 25 nm virus particles in crystalline array. The virions were exclusively intracytoplasmic and were morphologically indistinguishable from human poliomyelitis virus. These observations appear to establish DA as a picorna virus, related to the TME virus group.

Protection does not involve the suppression of virus replication in the central nervous system (CNS) or via augmentation of the antiviral antibody response. In the present report we have compared the CNS lesions induced by JHMV in lethally infected and T cell clone protected mice. The presence of virus-specific T cell clones induced a transient increase in mononuclear cell infiltration into the parenchyma of the brains of protected mice, consistent with previous data suggesting that a DTH response was responsible for protection. Immunohistochemical studies suggested further that virus was not replicating in the ependyma or cellular infiltrate, but that the presence of the T cell clone prevented neuronal infection.

This condition does not involve the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result of an antigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection or a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting the CNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) impermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As a result of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and inflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination. Several mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB. The role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in initiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains extremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions regarding the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or its forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading to bystander demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to the CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as a trigger or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical, neuropathological and experimental evidence. Along with another viral infection, it must be one of the commonest causes of progression of MS, and quite often leads to the onset of the clinical manifestations of an hitherto asymptomatic condition.",4/30/1993,"Poser, Charles M.",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-510x(93)90203-b

The collection of clones in such a random panel is contrasted with minimal panels suggested by algebraic coding theory. To approximate minimal panels we suggest the method of simulated annealing for selecting small, informative panels from larger existing collections of clones.

In medicine one important aspect of recombination is its role as one possible step in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. Since recombination may occur as a cellular response to DNA damage, the protection of cells from recombination-inducing agents, so-called recombinagen, should eliminate possible deleterious effects resulting from damage-induced DNA recombination. During the last few years, the awareness of the importance of recombination phenomena has substantially increased and the development of assay systems detecting recombinagens has progressed.

Sessions 3, 4, and 5 took place 1, 2, and 3 weeks later, respectively. In addition to measuring mood and mental performance, symptom severity was rated on a subjective checklist. The results showed that subjects with a cold reported an increase in negative mood and that this was only significant in the first week. Impairments of psychomotor function (simple reaction time and tracking) were also observed at this time. Performance of sustained and selective attention tasks was also impaired in subjects with colds but this effect was only significant in the second week. Other functions such as working and semantic memory were unimpaired in subjects with colds at any point in the experiment.

ICV injections of 1, 5, or 10 μg of oxytocin or isotonic saline in a volume of 5 μl were given. In females, ICV treatment with either saline or 5 μg of oxytocin caused a transient loss of weight within 24 h of treatment. However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight. After a 3-day treatment period an even greater difference in daily weight gain was seen between oxytocin-treated and saline-treated female rats of substrain A. In contrast, no difference in daily weight gain or food intake was observed between oxytocin- and saline-treated male rats of substrain A, nor in females or males of the more rapidly growing substrain B. Intraperitoneal injections of 5 μg of oxytocin did not influence food intake or daily weight gain in female rats of substrain A.

To extend the data base on potential health effects from coal liquefaction materials, we performed a study with solvent refined coal (SRC)-II heavy distillate (HD). Fischer-344 rats were exposed for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 5 or 13 weeks to an aerosol of HD (boiling range, 288 to 454°C) at concentrations of 0.69, 0.14, 0.03, or 0.0 mg/liter of air for the high, middle, low, and control groups, respectively. Survival through 13 weeks of exposure was greater than 90% for all groups; body weights for exposed animals were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. significant increases in liver weights and decreases in thymus and ovary weights were observed for treated animals compared with controls. There were also significant treatment-related decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, volume of packed red blood cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and total white blood cells. After 5 weeks of exposure serum cholesterol concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner for both sexes and serum triglyceride amounts decreased for males but not for females. After 13 weeks of exposure, high-dose animals had significant increases in cholesterol (males only), triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT; males) and significant decreases in albumin, SGPT (females), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Examination of bone-marrow preparations from exposed animals demonstrated consistent decreases in the degree of cellularity, suggesting that this organ is a target for HD. Microscopic evaluation of organ sections indicated exposure-related changes for nasal mucosa, pulmonary macrophages, thymus, liver, kidney, bone marrow, ovaries, and cecum.

Male F-344 rats were exposed to 175 ppm DMA 6 hr per day for 1, 2, 4, or 9 days or 2 years. Gross changes in nasal structure were recorded, effects of DMA on the mucociliary apparatus were assessed using video analysis, and tissues were evaluated for histopathology. In vitro nasal mucociliary flow patterns, mucus flow rates, and ciliary activity were studied and recorded for video motion analysis. There were distinct and generally consistent differences in the shape of the naso-, maxillo-, and ethmoid turbinates between young and old animals. Acute and chronic DMA exposures resulted in erosion of the anterior margins of the naso- and maxillo-turbinates and fenestration of the adjacent septum. Ciliastasis and mucostasis were observed only on the anteromedial aspect of the maxilloturbinate. In the chronically exposed rats, mucociliary activity was present in areas adjacent to erosions of the turbinates and septum. Abnormal mucus flow patterns, including altered or reversed direction of flow and “whirlpool-like” formation, were observed in all treated rats, but were more severe following chronic exposure. There was a good correlation between the distribution of responses as assessed by histopathology and abnormal mucociliary function at all time points. In conclusion, the mucociliary apparatus continues to function in the nasal passages of rats having localized destruction of nasal epithelium, induced by DMA exposure, and this clearance system responds to alterations of nasal structure by modification of mucus flow patterns.",9/30/1987,"Gross, E.A.; Patterson, D.L.; Morgan, K.T.",Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0041-008x(87)90129-3

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that adaptation is a result of alterations intrinsic to epithelial cells or to the cells and their matrix, and not due to systemic or neural influences. Rats were preexposed to either filtered air (FA) or 0.96 ppm O3 for 8 hr/night for 60 days, and then their tracheae were removed and exposed to 3 ppm O3 in an explant culture system where behavioral, nasal, exudative, and secretory product influences can be eliminated. After exposure to 3 ppm O3 in vitro, quantitative electron microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the epithelia from the FA preexposure group had significantly more necrotic cells and sloughed cells and fewer ciliated cells than the epithelia from the O3 preexposure group.

Models of rat lung injury, based on acute exposure to 2 ppm ozone for 3 hr and on exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone for 2 days, were used to determine whether EDU pretreatment of rats protected lungs from oxidant injury. Rats were pretreated with 100 mg/kg body wt EDU by ip administration for 2 days prior to and on the days of ozone exposure. No adverse toxicological effects of EDU pretreatment were observed. Lung superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly enhanced from 636 to 882 U/lung and from 599 to 856 U/lung, respectively. One day following acute exposure (2 ppm for 3 hr), an ozone-induced increase of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from 0.01 to 1.18 million cells/lung was decreased to 0.68 million by EDU pretreatment. No alteration occurred in the degree of lung permeability indicated by increased lavage fluid albumin. EDU pretreatment also significantly decreased ozone-induced increases in PMN recovery after 2 days exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone from 5.54 to 2.12 million cells/lung. However, in this second case, EDU pretreatment reduced the observed ozone damage, indicated by a decrease in lavage fluid albumin and by a decrease in the macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration associated with this length of ozone exposure. The observation that EDU-treated cultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased SOD and CAT activities identified a potential lung site of EDU interaction.

Membrane segregated cultures were used so that the influences of direct B-T cell contact and T cell factors on B cell differentiation could be independently evaluated. B-T cell contact was not absolutely required for Pb's enhancement of B cell maturation to antibody forming cells (AFCs); however, enhancement of the AFC response by Pb was optimal when B-T cell interactions were allowed. These results were corroborated by use of anti-L3T4 (mouse CD4) to block CD4+ T cell-B cell interaction. Blockade of B-T cell contact with anti-L3T4 did not inhibit the enhancement of the AFC response by Pb. Additional experimentation showed that Pb enhanced the AFC response and Ig production in the presence of antigen-specific T cell help, suggesting that Pb enhances B cell differentiation by augmenting cognate help rather than by inducing a response to Pb-altered-self.

The daily exposure regimen consisted of a 13-hr background of 0.06 ppm, an exposure peak that rose from 0.06 to 0.25 ppm, and returned to the background level over a 9-hr period, and 2-hr downtime for maintenance. Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery pefiod, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The accumulation of interstitial matrix after chronic exposure consisted of deposition of both increased amounts of basement membrane and collagen fibers. Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to O3 caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells.

Morphologically similar virus particles, approximately 95 nm in diameter, were encountered in all three systems, and a common mode of virus assembly and maturation appeared to obtain. Virus assembly was shown to occur exclusively at internal cytomembrane interfaces, the Golgi complex appearing as the initial assembly site, which site became less focal as infection progressed due to the proliferation of Golgi smooth membranes and the dilation of cisternae and vesicles. The assembly process involved viral budding into cisternal and vesicular lumina, the virion thereby acquiring its limiting membrane. The envelope of such intracellular virions exhibited a poorly defined fringe, approximately 8 nm in width, which appeared to undergo a maturational change as the virions were discharged from the cell, such that, extracellularly, virions displayed a well-developed fringe, approximately 12 nm wide—a change especially noteworthy in the case of virions in infected mouse brain. The presence was noted in infected Vero cells—and in one instance in an infected mosquito cell—of crescent-shaped segments of thickened cisternal membrane, which possibly represented an early phase of viral assembly in which nucleocapsid aligned itself in close apposition to a membrane segment preparatory to the initiation of budding. In areas of the cytoplasm adjacent to sites of viral assembly in neurons, a fine granulofibrillar matrix was frequently found, enmeshed in which were numbers of 50–60 nm spherical structures. In a low proportion of cells from infected mosquito cultures, dense granulofibrillar masses were found in the cytoplasm. In Vero cells, infection with CE virus was cytolytic, while in A. albopictus cells, no gross cytopathic effects were manifest, and persistently infected cultures developed upon subcultivation. However, less than 10% of challenged mosquito cells became productively infected and for a proportion of these, at least as determined by electron microscopy, the infection was lethal.",7/31/1973,"Lyons, Michael J.; Heyduk, Jaroslav",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(73)90112-8

Tube infectivity titers ranged from 109.0–109.5 TCID50/ml and plaque titers from 1010.2–1010.9 y PFU/ml at the time of peak virus production, when no cytopathology was evident. Virus titer dropped rapidly between 26 and 56 hr, coincident with increasing cytopathology. A single precipitin band was observed in immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis between concentrated virus preparations and antiserum to purified 229E. Neuraminidase and hemagglutinin assays were negative. Virus was purified by two procedures: adsorption to and elution from human “0” erythrocytes and CaHPO4 gel followed by equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation, and PEG precipitation followed by equilibrium glycerol/tartrate gradients and rate zonal sucrose or glycerol/tartrate gradients.

GP180 can be converted to GP90 in vitro by treatment of virions with trypsin. Analysis of tryptic digests of GP90 and GP180 give identical peptide patterns.

JHMV has a markedly greater neurotropism for weanling BALB/c mice than does A59V. Both viruses display one-hit kinetics when grown in vitro in 17CL-16 cells, a clone of BALB/c3T3 cells. Virus-specific intranuclear, cytoplasmic, and surface antigens have been observed for both viruses by immunofluorescence. The intranuclear antigen appears first at about 2 hr after infection (hpi) followed by the development of the cytoplasmic and surface antigens at 3 hpi at 38.5°. Most, if not all cells that develop the intranuclear antigen, produce cytoplasmic antigen and presumably progeny virus. Progeny virus production is independent of cell fusion and formation of syncytia. Virus-specific ribonucleoprotein is synthesized in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the synthesis of cellular ribonucleoprotein species that have sedimentation properties similar to the virus-specific species.

These mutants were selected for their inability to induce syncytia formation after low multiplicity infection (m.o.i. = 0.1 iU) in BALB/c 17CL-1 cells at 38.5° as compared to the induction of syncytia at 33°. N-Methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine (14 mutants) and 5-fluorouridine (20 mutants) were used as mutagens at a concentration that reduced infectivity by 90–95%. Characterization of these mutants included: induction of syncytia; synthesis of JHMV-specific intracellular RNA; progeny yields at 33, 37, and 38.5°; synthesis of JHMV-specific antigens as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; virion thermostability; neuropathogenesis including isolation of virus from infected brain, immunofluorescence of infected brain, and histopathology of brain and spinal cord by light and transmission electron microscopy; ability to protect mice from a lethal JHMV infection; and complementation.

Analysis by hybridization kinetics of the annealing between A59 [32P]cDNA and infected cell RNA from the other four MHV strains demonstrated 70–80% homology. By gel transfer analysis, the A59 [32P]cDNA was able to detect subgenomic-size virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with all of the five MHV strains. A similar pattern of seven viral RNAs was detected in cells infected with A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and JHM. In contrast, cells infected with MHV-S contained seven virus-specific RNAs, of which only the two smallest species comigrated with RNAs from the other four strains. The results suggest that as previously shown with A59 (S. Cheley, R. Anderson, M. J. Cupples, E. C. M. Lee Chan, and V. L. Morris (1981) Virology, 112, 596–604), all MHV strains tested encode a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled viral proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that each strain of MHV specified four major viral polypeptides with apparent molecular weights very similar to those previously reported for the E2, N, El, and PEI polypeptides of A59. The strong degree of interstrain homology among the five MHV strains investigated was confirmed by comparative chymotryptic peptide mapping of the viral N proteins. A majority of the chymotryptic peptides from each of the [35Sknethionine-labeled N proteins was found to coelute by high-performance liquid chromotography. Moreover, this technique of peptide mapping indicated a particularly strong relatedness between MHV-1 and MHV-S and among MHV-3, JHM, and A59.",12/31/1981,"Cheley, Steve; Morris, Vincent L.; Cupples, Margaret J.; Anderson, Robert",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(81)90113-6

Unlike envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the transmembrane glycoprotein El is glycosylated normally in the presence of tunicamycin. This suggests that glycosylation of El does not involve transfer of core oligosaccharides from dolichol pyrophosphate intermediates to asparagine residues, but may occur by 0-linked glycosylation of serine or threonine residues. Synthesis of the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 is not readily detectable in the presence of tunicamycin. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of E2 by tunicamycin either prevents synthesis or facilitates degradation of the protein moiety of E2. Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligcsaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms. In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells. These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release. The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane. The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1 appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins. These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a model for studying the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and intracellular transport of 0-linked glycoproteins.",12/31/1981,"Holmes, Kathryn V.; Doller, Elizabeth W.; Sturman, Lawrence S.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(81)90115-x

While the wild type produced large plaques consisting of fused cells (fusion type) both at 39 and at 32°, the mutant produced small fusion-type plaques at 39°, and at 32°, only after longer incubation, plaques consisting of round dead cells (non-fusion type) were obtained. The mutant grew equally well at both temperatures. Thus, the mutant was cold sensitive in inducing cell fusion, but not in replication or in ultimate cell killing. The cold sensitivity was overcome by the addition of trypsin (0.04 to 0.05%) to the culture medium, but not by treating the virions with trypsin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the virion proteins failed to detect differences between the wild type and the mutant. In intracellular viral proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-MHV-S rabbit serum, a protein of 68,000 daltons (68K protein) which was present in the wild type-infected cells was absent in the mutant-infected cells, but trypsin treatment or incubation at 39° of the mutant-infected cells failed to induce the 68K protein. After six to seven undiluted passages, the mutant segregated varieties of mutants which were partially or totally reverted to the wild type in phenotype, and also those whose cell fusion induction was absent even at 39°. All these mutants failed to induce the 68K protein in the infected cells. Thus, there was no linkage between the presence of 68K protein and the fusion induction. Trypsin treatment of the infected cells enabled MHV-S to form fusion plaques on otherwise resistant cells, and MHV-2, a producer of non-fusion-type plaques, to form fusion-type plaques.

Immunofluorescence showed that all cells became infected at a multiplicity of 10 PFU/cell. The virus was concentrated and purified to obtain the high titered stocks needed for these one-step growth experiments. Release of virus into the culture medium started 4 hr after infection (pi) and was complete at 10 hr pi. Synthesis of virus-specific RNA, measured by the incorporation of [3H]uridine in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, also started at 4 hr pi and its maximum rate occurred between 6 and 8 hr pi. RNA labeled during this period was isolated from infected cells. About 50% of this RNA bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured with glyoxal-dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Seven RNA species with the following molecular weights were present: 5.6 × 106 (RNA1), 4.0 × 106 (RNA2), 3.0 × 106 (RNA3), 1.4 × 106 (RNA4), 1.2 × 106 (RNA5), 0.9 × 106 (RNA6), and 0.6 × 106 (RNA7). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. To determine whether these RNA species were functional as messengers in infected cells, virus-specific RNAs present in polyribosomes were analyzed. EDTA treatment was used to discriminate between RNA present in polyribosomes and in EDTA-resistant, presumably ribonucleoprotein, particles. Most (91%) of RNA1 was present in EDTA-resistant particles; the remainder and all other RNAs synthesized between 6 and 8 hr pi were present in polyribosomes. We conclude that MHV-A59 has six subgenomic mRNAs.

The replication of three different MHV strains was studied in mouse dissociated spinal cord cultures containing differentiated neurons and nonneuronal cells (NN) (including astrocytes). Cell tropism and maturation of each virus strain was analyzed by immunolabeling methods using antisera to the virion or to purified membrane glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and by electron microscopy (EM). Wt-JHM, which causes acute encephalitis in mice, produces acute cytopathic changes in both neurons and NN cells. In neurons, virions mature in smooth ER cisternae closely associated to the Golgi apparatus. As judged by EM, fewer virions are produced by neurons than NN cells and neurons do not fuse or stain for E2 as do NN cells. NN cells contain large inclusions made of nucleocapsid strands. A temperature-sensitive mutant of JHM, Ts8-JHM, which causes demyelination in mice, infects NN cells but not neurons. Infected NN cells synthesize E1 and E2, and contain large inclusions but few mature virions, even at permissive temperatures. These inclusions appear granular and rarely contain nucleocapsid strands in contrast to wt-JHM infection. NN cells infected with this mutant also display numerous membrane whorls. The hepatotropic strain A59 lacks tropism for neurons and primarily infects NN cells, thus resembling ts8-JHM. Infected NN cells become loaded with intracytoplasmic virions which are secreted from the cells. E1 can only be detected in the perinuclear area of these cells while E2 rapidly spreads throughout the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of A59 infected NN cells frequently contains large tubular structures often in the lumen of the RER. In conclusion, in primary CNS cultures consisting of neurons and NN cells: (1) wt-JHM replicates in both neurons and NN cells but has different effects on these cells; (2) Ts8-JHM exhibits no productive infection of neurons, and in NN cells appears to be defective in assembly and to stimulate membrane synthesis; (3) A59 also shows tropism restricted to NN cells which produce many viruses and display differential distribution of the two virion glycoproteins. Thus, in the absence of the immune system, the MHV strains assayed exhibit differences in viral tropism, cytopathic changes, and viral assembly in CNS cells, and these differences may account for the different disease patterns.",6/30/1982,"Dubois-Dalcq, Monique E.; Doller, Elizabeth W.; Haspel, Martin V.; Holmes, Kathryn V.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(82)90092-7

Persistence in the LM-K cells was not accompanied by production of is mutants or of soluble anti-MHV factors. Infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by MHV of the LM-K cells as compared to L-2 cells. On an infected cell basis, production levels of infectious progeny and viral RNA were comparable between the two cell lines. The extent of virus-induced cell-cell fusion, however, was markedly reduced in the LM-K cells. Cell-mixing experiments showed that both infected L-2 and LM-K cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected L-2 cells but not with uninfected LM-K cells. This suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the LM-K infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface, but rather to an inherent resistance of the LM-K cell membrane to MHV-induced fusion. It is believed that such fusion resistance in LM-K cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture, thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence.",7/30/1983,"Mizzen, Lee; Cheley, Steve; Rao, Meena; Wolf, Robert; Anderson, Robert",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(83)90266-0

Other permissive cell lines differed according to the treatment period and drug level required for restricting productive infections. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was progressively reduced if infection of cells was delayed for increasing times after drug removal. Strong inhibition of viral replication also occurred in cells treated with the cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenylbutazone whereas phenacetin, which does not block cyclooxygenase function, was inactive. Enhanced viral replication occurred in indomethacin-treated HEp-2 cultures when these cells were subsequently exposed to such substances as prostaglandin El, cyclic AMP, or insulin. Conversely, indomethacin-treated cells remained restrictive for VSV if they were subsequently exposed to metabolic inhibitors of functional DNA (actinomycin D or mitomycin C), messenger RNA synthesis (α-amanitin), or protein synthesis (cycloheximide) at concentrations that normally do not compromise viral replication. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with mitomycin C markedly shifted the dose response for indomethacin-mediated inhibition of VSV from a 90% inhibitory dose of about 10−4 M to one of 10−9 M or lower.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum anti-JHM virus IgG concentrations present in rats prior to onset of clinical symptoms or during the acute and paralytic phases of disease were compared. High CSF/serum ratios, indicative of local antibody production in the CNS, were noted only where disease was demonstrable suggesting that local antibody production accompanied the infection but did not prevent the neurological disease. Among animals in which neurologic symptoms had not become manifest, only those with elevated CSF/serum ratios were found to have histological CNS lesions. Immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that viral antigens were present in both glia and neurons. Antigen-positive cells were frequently present in histologically normal CNS tissue, while regions of necrosis were antigen negative. Testing for the presence of viral RNA with JHM cDNA probes revealed that the virus was rapidly disseminated throughout the CNS, presumably establishing centers of infection prior to the development of recognizable tissue damage. Viral RNA was also detected in the CNS following recovery from paralysis and as late as 5 months postinfection, where no disease occurred. These findings indicate that, although infection by JHM virus can spread rapidly throughout the CNS, formation of lesions during chronic disease is a slower process.

The genomic RNA of the virus population (JHM-CC virus) released from different passage levels of the same persistent infection has also been analyzed.

The analysis also identifies in each subgenomic RNA those large T1 oligonucleotides derived from noncontiguous regions of the genome during mRNA synthesis. Two important conclusions can be reached from analysis of the mutant viruses. First, the virus population released from the persistent infection represents a fairly constant mixture of viruses, and the fluctuating emergence of variants as predominant species in the culture does not occur. Second, the data indicate that for particular intracellular RNAs of mutant viruses the sequence rearrangements occurring during subgenomic mRNA synthesis are different from those in the corresponding intracellular RNA of wild-type virus.

Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins. Tunicamycin completely blocked glycosylation of GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7. In contrast, GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b were partially glycosyaated in the presence of tunicamycin. These results indicated that GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7 are N-linked glycoproteins, but GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensin-treated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay.

This presentation deals with specificity of the murine viscerotropic MHV3 and neurotropic JHMV for explanted cells from the CNS of newborn, inbred, Wistar-Furth rats. An unambiguous tropism of MHV3 for astrocytes and JHMV for oligodendrocytes is demonstrated. With the latter cell-virus interaction, relatively small differences in spatial density of oligodendrocytes influence profoundly the duration of persistence and virus yield. The in vitro temporal program of oligodendrocyte differentiation, monitored by induction of a myelin-related enzyme, 2′:3′-cyclic nucleotide-3′-phosphohydrolase, corresponds to that occurring in vivo (F. A. McMorris, J. Neurochem. 41, 506–515, 1983). It is complete within 15–21 days and is coincident with the onset of insusceptibility to disease caused by JHMV. Experimental elevation of intracellular cyclic-AMP levels, presumed to reflect oligodendrocyte differentiation, likewise suppresses JHMV replication without affecting that of MHV3 in astrocytes. On the basis of these data it is concluded that in vitro interaction of JHMV with oligodendrocytes reflects accurately the in vivo host control over the tropism and expression of this virus, thereby effecting the progressive, demyelinative disease, process.",2/28/1985,"Beushausen, S.; Dales, S.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(85)90185-0

The apparent molecular weights of P81, P53, and P49 changed significantly according to the composition of the lysis buffer used, suggesting that the differences in their molecular weights were due to conformational changes produced by reduction of their intramolecular disulfide bonds.

In cells infected with MHV-S or MHV-JHM the amount of viral mRNAs was remarkably reduced by IFN treatment. Also the levels of the major intracellular viral proteins, in particular the E, protein, were affected by IFN treatment. Similar effects could not be demonstrated in MHV-2-infected cells.

T-ag was metabolically labeled in SV40-infected cells with tritiated galactose or glucosamine, but not with mannose or fucose. The identity of glycosylated T-ag was established by immunoprecipitation with a variety of T-ag-specific antisera, including monoclonal antibodies. Incorporation of labeled sugar into T-ag was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled sugars, but not in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acids. Labeled monosaccharides could be preferentially removed from T-ag with a mixture of glycosidic enzymes. In addition, galactose was removed from purified T-ag by acid hydrolysis and identified as such by thin-layer chromatography. T-ag oligosaccharides were resistant to treatment with EndoH, and glycosylation was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Together, these data strongly suggest that T-ag is glycosylated. Several characteristics, including lack of mannose labeling, EndoH resistance, and tunicamycin resistance, suggest that T-ag is not an N-linked glycoprotein.

This delay was seen in the production of both intracellular and extracellular virus. However, the final titers were similar to those produced by MHV-infected cells maintained in normal medium. The manifestation of virus-induced cell fusion was similarly found to be delayed, but not otherwise decreased in severity, when ammonium chloride was present in the culture medium. Ammonium chloride caused similar delays in production of virus-specific, positive-sense RNAs and of viral polypeptides. The relative proportions and apparent molecular weights of viral RNAs and polypeptides were similar to those found in MHV-infected cells cultured in normal medium. In vitro translation of endogenously produced viral RNAs in cell extracts, prepared from MHV-infected cells, was not inhibited by ammonium chloride. Thus, ammonium chloride has no specific, inhibitory effect on viral protein synthesis. Ammonium chloride did not reduce the number of virus-infected cells in culture, as monitored by infectious center assay. Analysis of early events in MHV infection showed that ammonium chloride did not affect adsorption or internalization of MHV by L-2 cells. However, the subsequent eclipse phase, as monitored by decline in infectivity of internalized virus inoculum proceeded less efficiently in the presence of ammonium chloride. On the basis of the known inhibitory effects of ammonium chloride on lysosomal/endosomal functions, the results suggest an endosomal mechanism of MHV uncoating. Thus the primary effect of ammonium chloride on MHV infection of L-2 cells is to attenuate virus uncoating, thereby chronologically displacing all subsequent virus-encoded functions.",4/30/1985,"Mizzen, Lee; Hilton, Anne; Cheley, Steve; Anderson, Robert",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(85)90345-9

We have isolated and characterized revertants of ts24, a member of the A complementation group of Sindbis HR mutants, that we had demonstrated previously to have a temperature-sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis. These revertants of ts24 replicated efficiently at 40° but nevertheless retained the temperature sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis: they continued to synthesize minus strands late in the replication cycle at 40° but not at 30° and in the presence or absence of protein synthesis. Although failure to regulate the synthesis of minus strands resulted in continuous minus-strand synthesis and in the accumulation of minus strands, the rate of plus-strand synthesis was not increased concertedly. Minus strands synthesized after the rate of plus-strand synthesis had become constant were demonstrated to be utilized as templates for 26 S mRNA synthesis. Thus, the change from an increasing to a constant rate of plus-strand synthesis during the alphavirus replication cycle cannot be governed solely by the number of minus strands that accumulate in infected cells.

Our previous results indicated that the mouse-adapted phenotype maps to the Lansing viral capsid. To further define regions of the capsid that are specifically involved in the infection of mice, antigenic variants resistant to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies were selected, and their mouse neurovirulence was studied. The monoclonal antibodies used were directed against antigenic site 1, an immunodominant loop of capsid polypeptide VP1 located on the virion surface. Ten of twenty-two variants selected had lower intracerebral neurovirulence in mice when compared to the parental virus. Four of the ten antigenic variants with reduced neurovirulence were temperature sensitive (ts) for replication in HeLa cells, while the remaining six variants replicated in HeLa cells as well as the parent virus. Two ts+ variants that were studied had a reduced ability to replicate in the mouse brain. There was no difference in the histopathology and pattern of involvement in the central nervous system of one variant compared to the parent virus. In three variants, reduction of neurovirulence correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at positions 100 and 101 of VP1, located within antigenic site 1. The is phenotype in three variants was associated with a single amino acid deletion at position 105. Virus recovered from the brain of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the antigenic variants was characterized to identify the virus causing disease. In most cases, brain isolates resembled the inoculated virus in neurovirulence and amino acid sequence at the antigenic site.

In the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin the viral glycoproteins were equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition GIc3Man8,9(GIcNAc)2 and the yield of virus in the extracellular medium was reduced as a result of a block in the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor (pE2) of the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein. The mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) also inhibited the appearance of virus in the medium and the oligosaccharides on the viral glycoproteins had the composition Man9(GIcNAc)2. However, pE2 was cleaved to E2 under these conditions, and it was found that when the yield of virus from the cells and medium together was considered, there was no difference between untreated and dMM-treated cultures, suggesting the presence of intracellular virus particles in the dMM-treated cultures. When examined by electron microscopy, the dMM-treated cultures were found to contain intracellular virus particles. In addition, nucleocapsids were found lining intracellular membranes.

The activity was influenced, possibly indirectly, by the length of prior treatment of infected cells with actinomycin D; however, 6 μg/ml actinomycin D and 10−5 M α-amanitin in the RDRP assay had no effect. The replication complex was membrane-bound and Mg2+ was essential for RDRP activity. Incorporation was more dependent on exogenous UTP and GTP than ATP or CTP. The specific activity was low, and rate of incorporation of GMP decreased as the period of assay was increased; however, incorporation of label lasted for at least 60 min. RNA products were fractionated by LiCl precipitation, and kinetic studies showed that the sequence of accumulation of label was the same as that observed in vivo, viz., RI → RF → 44 S RNA; limited reinitiation was also observed.

To elucidate the precise mechanism of leader-priming, we cloned and sequenced the 5′-end of the mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA. The 5′-terminal sequences are identical to the leader sequences present at the 5′-end of the subgenomic mRNAs. Two possible hairpin loop structures and an AU-rich region around the 3′-end of the leader sequence may provide the termination site for leader RNA synthesis. The comparison of 5′-end genomic sequences and the intergenic start sites for mRNA transcription revealed that there are homologous regions of 7–18 nucleotides at the putative leader/body junction sites. Some intergenic regions contain a mismatching nucleotide within this homologous region. We propose that free leader RNA binds to the intergenic region due to this homology and is cleaved at the mismatching nucleotide before serving as a primer. Thus, the free leader RNA species may be longer than the leader sequences in the subgenomic mRNAs and different mRNAs may have different leader/body junction sites.",2/28/1987,"Shieh, Chien-Kou; Soe, Lisa H.; Making, Shinji; Chang, Ming-Fu; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,FALSE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(87)90412-0

Stohlman, and M. M. C. Lai (1986) J. Virol. 57, 729–737). To better define the mechanism of RNA recombination, we have performed additional crosses involving different sets of MHV strains. Three or possibly four classes of recombinants were isolated. Recombinants in the first class, which are similar to the ones previously reported, contain a single crossover in either gene A or B, which are the 5′-most genes. The second class of recombinants contain double crossovers in gene A. The third class of recombinants have crossovers within the leader sequence located at the 5′-end of the genome. The crossover sites of the third class have been located between 35 and 60 nucleotides from the 5′-end of the leader RNA. One of these recombinants has double crossovers within the short region comprising the leader sequences. Finally, we describe one recombinant which may contain a triple crossover. The presence of so many recombination sites within the 5′-end of the genome of murine coronaviruses confirms that RNA recombination is a frequent event during MHV replication and is consistent with our proposed model of “copy-choice” recombination in which RNA replication occurs in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner.",2/28/1987,"Keck, James G.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Side, Lisa H.; Makino, Shinji; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(87)90413-2

In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these small RNAs. Using cDNA probes specific for leader RNA and genes A, D, and F, we demonstrate that subsets of these small RNAs were derived from the various viral genes. These subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes, varying with the gene from which they are derived. The size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure, whose free energy ranges from −1.6 to −77.1 kcal/mol, in each of the mRNAs examined. In addition, identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA, suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates. The biological significance of these small RNAs is further supported by the detection of leader-containing RNAs of 47, 50, and 57 nucleotides in length, which correspond to the crossover sites in two MHV recombinant viruses. These data, coupled with the high frequency of RNA recombination during MHV infection, suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure, thereby generating pools of free leader-containing RNA intermediates which can reassociate with the template, acting as primers for the synthesis of full-length or recombinant RNAs.

Two DI-specific RNA species, DIssA of genomic size and DIssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells. Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DIssA and only a trace amount of DIssE RNA. Despite its negligible amount, the DIssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DIssE RNA in infected cells. This conclusion was supported by two studies. First, the uv target size for DIssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DIssA. Second, when purified DIssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DIssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells. Thus, DIssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles. By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DIssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus. In contrast, DIssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself.

Although euthymic littermates regularly shed virus, in the nude mice only about 20% of isolation attempts up to 100 days postinfection were positive. Blind passage yielded an additional three isolations out of 14 samples (21 %). In addition, unlike many other herpesviruses, the virus did not replicate in a number of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines that were tested.

In contrast, infection of the LM-K subline leads to virus persistence with reduced cell fusion. We undertook studies designed to elucidate the role of host cell membrane lipid composition and the cytoskeleton in modulating the fusion process and the resultant effect(s) on virus persistence. MHV-induced cell fusion proceeded normally in cells treated with cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs, cytochalasin B and colchicine. Modification of cell membrane fatty acid composition by supplementation of LM-K cells with arachidonic (C-20:4) or palmitic (C-16:0) acids had little effect on the extent of MHV-induced cell fusion or on virus replication. However, supplementation of both cell types with cholesterol (resulting in increased membrane cholesterol/fatty acid ratio) resulted in marked enhancement of virus-mediated cell fusion. The increase in cell membrane cholesterol did not enhance internalization of MHV suggesting that cholesterol primarily modulates a later event. This suggestion was confirmed by demonstrating cholesterol-enhancement of fusion in a contact fusion assay. Cholesterol-supplemented L-2 cells were less productive for virus replication than unsupplemented cells, in agreement with our previous observations that MHV replication is compromised by extensive cytopathic effect. Although cholesterol-supplemented LM-K cells showed increased susceptibility to MHV-mediated cell fusion, the extent of such susceptibility did not approach that observed in L-2 cells. Also, the property of LM-K cells to support MHV persistence was not abolished by cholesterol supplementation.

To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a 35S-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain.

It is positioned at the 5′ side of the nucleocapsid (N) gene from which it is separated by an intergenic stretch of 12 bases. The deduced M protein comprises 262 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 29,544, is moderately hydrophobic, and has a net charge of +7 at neutral pH. Thirty-four percent of its amino acid sequence is homologous with the M protein of the bovine coronavirus (BCV), 32% with that of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), and 19% with that of the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV). Judging from alignment with the BCV, MHV, and IBV M proteins, the amino terminus of the TGEV M protein extends 54 amino acids from the virion envelope which compares with only 28 for BCV, 26 for MHV, and 21 for IBV. Eleven of the sixteen amino-terminal amino acids are hydrophobic and the positions of charged amino acids around this sequence suggest that the first 16 amino acids comprise a potentially cleavable signal peptide for membrane insertion. A similar sequence is not found in the M proteins of BCV, MHV, or IBV. When mRNA from infected cells, or RNA prepared by in vitro transcription of the reconstructed M gene, was translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes, the M protein became translocated and glycosylated. When a protein without the amino-terminal signal peptide was made by translating a truncated version of the M gene transcript, some translocation and glycosylation also occurred suggesting that the amino-terminal signal peptide on the TGEV M protein is not an absolute requirement for membrane translocation. Interestingly, the amino-terminal peptide did not appear to be cleaved during in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes suggesting that a step in virion assembly may be required for proper exposure of the cleavage site to the signal peptidase.",8/31/1988,"Kapke, Paul A.; Tung, Frank Y.T.; Hogue, Brenda G.; Brian, David A.; Woods, Roger D.; Wesley, Ronald",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(88)90581-8

In addition to these internal deletions, various truncated RNAs were detected lacking either partially or completely the 3′ terminal region which is supposed to code for viral replicase. RNA molecules with internal deletions as well as those with 3′ terminal truncations could also be extracted directly from infected cells. During multiple consecutive passages of a given HAV strain, deletions A, B, and C accumulated and a quantitative increase of deleted RNAs occurred. Type and predominance of deletions varied with virus strains (CLF, GBM, MBB11/5, HM175, CR326, H141) and with the type of cells used for propagation (MRC-5, BGM, HELF, PLC/PRF/5). However, within the limits of the reliability of S1 analysis the endpoints of deletions A, B, and C were conserved. The mechanisms leading to formation of deletions remain unclear.

Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated is into 2-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated is into 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHV-JHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATIIf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2- or 10-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus. ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitis when reinoculated into 2-or 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats.

To further understand the molecular biology of human coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E), molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the viral RNA have been initiated. Following established protocols, the 3′-terminal 1732 nucleotides of the genome were sequenced. A large open reading frame encodes a 389 amino acid protein of 43,366 Da, which is presumably the nucleocapsid protein. The predicted protein is similar in size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence to the nucleocapsid proteins of other coronaviruses. This is especially evident when the sequence is compared with that of the antigenically related porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), with which a region of 46% amino acid sequence homology was found. Hydropathy profiles revealed the existence of several conserved domains which could have functional significance. An intergenic consensus sequence precedes the 5′-end of the proposed nucleocapsid protein gene. The consensus sequence is present in other coronaviruses and has been proposed as the site of binding of the leader sequence for mRNA transcriptional start. This region was also examined by primer extension analysis of mRNAs, which identified a 60-nucleotide leader sequence.

The 3'-region of this leader sequence contains several repeats of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA), whose number varies among different MHV strains. It has been demonstrated that this UCUAA repeat plays crucial roles in the discontinuous transcription of MHV mRNAs. In the present study, we demonstrate that the number of UCUAA repeats in the leader sequence of MHV genome rapidly decreases during serial passages of viruses on susceptible cells. The downward evolution of the number of UCUAA repeats was not due to a higher growth rate of the viruses with fewer repeats, but seemed to be due to homologous interference between viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeat. The ease with which these variant viruses arose suggests the high frequency of the occurrence of this deletion during RNA replication. This finding is in agreement with the proposed discontinuous and nonprocessive mode of coronavirus RNA synthesis. Analysis of the intracellular subgenomic mRNA species of viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeats and of MHV recombinant viruses suggests that the number of this pentanucleotide repeat at the 3′-end of the leader sequence may regulate the synthesis of certain mRNA species, in agreement with the leader-primed transcription mechanism.",3/31/1989,"Makino, Shinji; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(89)90060-3

Mosquito cell lines released E at a similar rate (t 1 2 > 8 hr), while NS1 and NS1′ were retained in an undegraded form in the cell layer. The proteolytic processing of the three proteins appeared identical in both cell types, but some differences in Winked glycosylation were observed. E, NS1, and NS1′ found within the infected cells of both types contained high-mannose oligosaccharide groups for more than 8 hr after synthesis. Additional sugar residues were added to the single E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from Vero cells, while sugar residues were trimmed from the E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from mosquito cells. The forms of NS1 and NS1′ found in the culture fluid of infected Vero cells contained one complex and one high-mannose oligosaccharide. All three glycoproteins released from JE-infected Vero cells were associated with extracellular particles, the virion in the case of E and a low density particle in the case of NS1′ and NSV. Furthermore, E, NS1′ and NS1′ exhibited amphipathic properties in Triton X-114 extraction experiments.

Suckling C578L/6 mice infected intranasally with MHV-JHM develop either the acute encephalomyelitis or a late onset, symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis, depending on whether they are nursed by unimmunized or immunized dams. Analysis by in situ hybridization was used to determine the route of entry of MHV-JHM into the CNS in these mice. At early times, viral RNA was detected only in the trigeminal and olfactory nerves and in their immediate connections in all mice. A few days later, MHV-JHM RNA was found throughout the brain in mice dying of the acute encephalomyelitis, but remained confined to the entry sites in mice which did not develop acute disease. These results suggest that MHV-JHM enters the CNS via an interneuronal route in all mice, but that the presence of maternal antibody prevents the dissemination of virus via extracellular fluid.

In this study, the biosynthetic pathway and possible biological activities of this protein were examined. The glycosylation of gp65 in virus-infected cells was inhibited by tunicamycin but not by monensin, suggesting that it contains an N-glycosidic linkage. Glycosylation is cotranslational and appears to be complete before the glycoprotein reaches the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase experiments showed that this protein decreased in size after 30 min of chase, suggesting that the carbohydrate chains of gp65 undergo trimming during its transport across the Golgi. This interpretation is supported by the endoglycosidase treatment of gp65, which showed that the peptide backbone of gp65 did not decrease in size after pulse-chase periods. This maturation pathway is distinct from that of the E1 or E2 glycoproteins. Partial endoglycosidase treatment indicated that gp65 contains 9 to 10 carbohydrate side chains; thus, almost all of the potential glycosylation sites of gp65 were glycosylated.

We find experimentally that most of the Phe-tRNA present in HIV-1 infected cells lacks the highly modified Wye base in its anticodon loop and most of the Asn-tRNA in HTLV-1 and BLV infected cells lacks the highly modified Q base in its anticodon loop. Interestingly, Phe-tRNA translates a UUU codon within the ribosomal frameshift signal in HIV and Asn-tRNA translates a AAC codon within the proposed frameshift signals in HTLV-1 and BLV.

Cocultivation of the BPV-transformed cell lines with FIPV-permissive feline fcwf-D cells resulted in polykaryocyte formation. Since it depended on the presence of fcwf-D cells, binding of E2 to the cell receptor may be required for membrane fusion. E2 was synthesized as a core-glycosylated protein of 180K which was only slowly transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the medial Golgi: of the E2-molecules labeled during a 1-hr pulse about half was still completely sensitive to endoglycosidase H after a 2-hr chase, while the remaining E2 had been chased into multiple, partially endoglycosidase H-resistant forms.

The quantity of the individual MV mRNA species was quite different in comparison to lytically infected Vero cells.

At the nucleotide level, the N gene sequences of these viral strains, and that of MHV-JHM, were more than 92% conserved overall.

All five N genes were found to encode markedly basic proteins of 454 or 455 residues having at least 94% sequence identity in pairwise comparisons. However, amino acid sequence divergences were found to be clustered in two short segments of N, putative spacer regions that, together, constituted only 11% of the molecule. Thus, the data suggest that the MHV N protein is composed of three highly conserved structural domains connected to each other by regions that have much less constraint on their amino acid sequences. The first two conserved domains contain most of the excess of basic amino acid residues; by contrast, the carboxy-terminal domain is acidic.

For a wide variety of viruses, including murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus), vesicular stomatitis virus (a rhabdovirus), and two paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and SV5), susceptibility to virus-induced fusion was found to be inversely correlated with susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion. This phenomenon was observed both for cell fusion occurring in the course of viral infection and for fusion induced “from without” by the addition of high titers of noninfectious or inactivated virus. The fusion-altered cell lines (fusible by virus but not by PEG) are characterized by their unusual lipid composition, including marked elevation of saturated fatty acids and the presence of an unusual ether-linked neutral lipid. To test the association between lipid composition and fusion, acyl chain saturation was manipulated by supplementing the culture medium with exogenous fatty acids. In such experiments, it was possible to control the responses of these cells to both viral and chemical fusogens. Increasing the cellular content of saturated fatty acyl chains increased the susceptibility of cells to viral fusion and decreased susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion, whereas lowering fatty acid saturation had the opposite effect. Thus, parallel cultures of cells can be either driven toward the PEG-fusible/virus-fusion-resistant phenotype of the parental cells or rendered susceptible to viral fusion but resistant to PEG-induced fusion, solely by the alteration of cellular lipids.

The RUB genomic RNA is 9757 nucleotides in length [excluding the poly(A) tail] and has a G/C content of 69.5%, the highest of any RNA virus sequenced to date. The RUB genomic RNA contains two long open reading frames (ORFs), a 5′-proximal ORF of 6656 nucleotides and a 3′-proximal ORF of 3189 nucleotides which encodes the structural proteins. Thus, the genomic organization of RUB is similar to that of alphaviruses, the other genus of the Togavirus family, and the 5′-proximal ORF of RUB therefore putatively codes for the nonstructural proteins. Sequences homologous to three regions of nucleotide sequence highly conserved among alphaviruses (a stem-and-loop structure at the 5′ end of the genome, a 51-nucleotide conserved sequence near the 5′ end of the genome, and a 20-nucleotide conserved sequence at the subgenomic RNA start site) were found in the RUB genomic RNA. Amino acid sequence comparisons between the nonstructural ORF of RUB and alphaviruses revealed only one short (122 amino acids) region of significant homology, indicating that these viruses are only distantly related. This region of homology is located at the NH2 terminus of nsP3 in the alphavirus genome. The RUB nonstructural protein ORF contains two global amino acid motifs conserved in a large number of positive-polarity RNA viruses, a motif indicative of helicase activity and a motif indicative of replicase activity. The order of the helicase motif and the nsP3 homology region in the RUB genome is reversed with respect to the alphavirus genome indicating that a genetic rearrangement has occurred during the evolution of these viruses.",7/31/1990,"Dominguez, Geraldina; Wang, Chin-Yen; Frey, Teryl K.",Virology,,,FALSE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(90)90476-8

The 4.9- and 4.8-kDa proteins appear to be vestiges of an 11-kDa protein for which a single nucleotide deletion event in the central part of the gene gave rise to a stop codon. The consensus CYAAAC sequence precedes the 4.9-, 12.7-, and 9.5-kDa ORFs and predicts that transcription will start from each of these sites. Northern analyses using sequence-specific probes and oligo(dT)-selected RNA demonstrated that the predicted transcripts are made, and that these correspond to mRNAs 4, 5, and 5-1. BCV mRNA 4 appears to be a counterpart to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mRNA 4 which, in the MHV JHM strain, encodes the putative 15.2-kDa nonstructural protein. BCV mRNAs 5 and 5-1 appear to be used for the synthesis of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins, respectively, which demonstrates a pattern of expression strikingly different from that utilized by MHV. MHV makes its homologs of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins from the single mRNA 5. In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the BCV 9.5-kDa protein, unlike its MHV counterpart, is poorly made from downstream initiation of translation.

Most of the virus was neutralized in the first 2–3 min of a reversible reaction, which was followed by a second phase with a decreased neutralization rate and, in some cases, by a persistent fraction, which was a function of the MAb and of the antibody-to-virus ratio. Neutralization of TGEV is a specific event that requires the location of the epitope involved in the neutralization in the appropriate structural context, which is present in the wild-type virus but not in certain MAb escaping mutants. In neutralization of TGEV by binary combinations of MAbs specific for the same or for different antigenic sites, either no cooperation or a synergistic effect, respectively, was observed. Mechanisms of TGEV neutralization by MAbs were characterized at high, intermediate, and low antibody-to-virus ratios. Under these conditions, mainly three steps of the replication cycle were inhibited: binding of virus to the cell, internalization, and a step that takes place after internalization.

Recombination frequencies between different is mutants increased steadily during infection and peaked late in the virus growth cycle. These data suggest that recombination is a late event in the virus replication cycle. Recombination frequencies were also found to range from 63 to 20,000 times higher than the sum of the spontaneous reversion frequencies of each is mutant used in the cross. Utilizing standard genetic recombination techniques, the five RNA− complementation groups of MHV-A59 were arranged into an additive, linear, genetic map located at the 5′ end of the genome in the 23-kb polymerase region.

Treatment of mouse L-2 fibroblasts with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or dansylcadaverine inhibited infection of MHV to a much lesser degree than that of VSV, suggesting a relatively minor role for the endocytic pathway and functional endosomes in MHV infection. Endocytosis of MHV and VSV into L-2 cells was assayed by the recovery of infectious (i.e., not uncoated) viruses from homogenates of cells harvested within the first few minutes of infection (and treated with protease to remove surface-bound virus). The results thus suggest that while a small proportion of the MHV inoculum is internalized by endocytosis, productive infection does not depend on functional endocytosis as utilized by VSV. Studies on direct virion-mediated cell fusion showed that MHV can induce fusion at pH 7.4, whereas VSV causes fusion at pH 5.0. Taken together, the above results suggest that MHV enters L-2 cells predominantly by membrane fusion with a non-acidified compartment such as the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, or endosomes (prior to their acidification). Results obtained from cell lines which differed in permissiveness to MHV infection suggested that the ability to support MHV infection does not correlate with endocytosis. Rather, nonpermissive cells, such as rat astrocytoma (C-6) and Vero cells, showed higher levels of recoverable internalized MHV than did fully permissive L-2 cells. Cells which are normally nonpermissive to MHV, could be rendered MHV-susceptible by PEG-induced fusion of cell surface-bound virus. Such PEG-mediated susceptibility to MHV infection was insensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride, supporting the idea that host cell restriction of MHV infection in C-6 and Vero cells may be due to a block in nonendosomal membrane fusion.

We have determined the complete sequence of this gene of the JHM strain by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The total length of this gene is 21,798 nucleotides long, which includes two overlapping, large open reading frames. The first open reading frame, ORF 1 a, is 4488 amino acids long. The second open reading frame, ORF 1 b, overlaps ORF 1 a for 75 nucleotides, and is 2731 amino acids long. The overlapping region may fold into a pseudoknot RNA structure, similar to the corresponding region of the RNA of avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The in vitro transcription and translation studies of this region indicated that these two ORFs were most likely translated into one polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Thus, the predicted molecular weight of the gene 1 product is more than 800,000 Da. The sequence of ORF 1 b is very similar to the corresponding ORF of IBV. In contrast, the ORF 1 a of these two viruses differ in size and have a high degree of divergence. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested that ORF 1 a contains several functional domains, including two hydrophobic, membrane-anchoring domains, and three cysteine-rich domains. It also contains a picornaviral 3C-like protease domain and two papain-like protease domains. The presence of these protease domains suggests that the polyprotein is most likely processed into multiple protein products. In contrast, the ORF 1b contains polymerase, helicase, and zinc-finger motifs.

In order to characterize the structure of these antigenic sites, we constructed a series of cDNA clones encoding deleted or truncated S1 derivatives and expressed the modified genes in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes A and B recognized only the mutant S1 polypeptides containing amino acids 324–720, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. In addition, two domains within this region were identified and only mutants containing both domains were immunoreactive, indicating that both were critical in the formation of the antigenic determinants. One domain was localized between residues 324 and 403 and the other at residues 517–720. Deletion of either domain inhibited extracellular secretion of the mutant proteins whereas mutants containing both or none of the domains were secreted efficiently. This observation suggests a vital function of the native conformation of the S1 protein in both antigenic structure and intracellular transport.

The residues that contribute to these sites were localized by sequence analysis of 21 mutants that escaped neutralization or binding by TGEV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and by epitope scanning (PEPSCAN). Site A contains the residues 538, 591, and 543, which are essential in the formation of subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac, respectively. In addition, mar mutant 1B.H6 with residue 586 changed had partially altered both subsite Aa and Ab, indicating that these subsites overlap in residue 586; i.e. this residue also is part of site A. The peptide 537-MKSGYGQPIA-547 represents, at least partially, subsite Ac which is highly conserved among coronaviruses. This site is relevant for diagnosis and could be of interest for protection. Other residues contribute to site B (residues 97 and 144), site C (residues 50 and 51), and site D (residue 385). The location of site D is in agreement with PEPSCAN results.

During the second cycle of infection, the mutant was able to infect efficiently periglomerular cells in the MOB and neurons of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, which indicates that maturation of infective particles is not affected in primarily infected neuronal cells. On the other hand, other neuronal cells permissive for CVS, such as mitral cells or the anterior olfactory nucleus, are completely free of infection with the mutant, indicating that restriction is related to the ability of AvO1 to penetrate several categories of neurons. From these observations, we concluded that CVS should be able to bind several different receptors to penetrate neurons, while the mutant would be unable to recognize some of them.",7/31/1991,"Lafay, F.; Coulon, P.; Astic, L.; Saucier, D.; Riche, D.; Holley, A.; Flamand, A.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(91)90145-2

In this study we have constructed a series of full length or truncated mutants of the G2 glycoprotein of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae, and investigated their transport properties. The results indicate that the hydrophobic domain preceding the G2 glycoprotein can function as a translocational signal peptide, and that the hydrophobic domain near the C-terminus serves as a membrane anchor. A G2 glycoprotein construct with an extra hydrophobic sequence derived from the N-terminal NSM region was stably retained in the ER, and was unable to be transported to the Golgi complex. The full-length G2 glycoprotein, when expressed on its own, was transported out of the ER and expressed on the cell surface, whereas the G1 and G2 proteins when expressed together are retained in the Golgi complex. A truncated anchor-minus form of the G2 glycoprotein was found to be secreted into the culture medium, but was retained in the Golgi complex when coexpressed with the G1 glycoprotein. These results indicate that the G2 membrane glycoprotein is a class I membrane protein which does not contain a signal sufficient for Golgi retention, and suggest that its Golgi localization is a result of association with the G1 glycoprotein.",7/31/1991,"Chen, Si-Yi; Matsuoka, Yumiko; Compans, Richard W.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(91)90148-5

The S gene sequences of these viral strains were compared with those of recently published strains BCV-Mebus, BCV-Quebec, and BCV-F15. An open reading frame of 4092 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 1363 amino acid residues, was found in all six strains. Frameshifts and insertions or deletions were not observed except for the BCV-Fl 5. The S gene sequences were more than 98% conserved overall inspite of different origins of the six viruses. There were 45 to 56 nt differences between the virulent and avirulent groups while there were 6 to 14 nt differences among four avirulent strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the S proteins had typical properties of membrane glycoproteins. Nineteen Winked glycosylation sites were predicted in five strains, and 18 of them were conserved in the avirulent strain BCV-L9.

Immunoblots with antibodies elicited against the purified glycoprotein from virus particles reacted with a fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli, indicating that the cloned ORF encodes the G protein. The 5′ end of the G protein mRNA corresponds to nt 5111, relative to the 3′ end of the viral (minus sense) genome, as determined by primer extension from mRNA isolated from infected plants, and extends to nt position 7155 on the genomic RNA.

The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s).

In this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus, using polymerase chain reaction, in the absence of selection pressure. Our results showed that within a 1-kb region of the peplomer gene, RNA recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site. Thus, coronavirus RNA recombination appears to be more random than previously realized. However, after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture, the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported “hot spot” for coronavirus recombination. These results suggest that RNA recombination is common and random in nature, but only certain recombinants can be selected. Thus, the presence of recombinational “hot spots” for coronavirus or other RNA viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of RNA recombination. The failure to detect recombinants in other RNA viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses. This approach can be used to detect recombinants in these viruses.",11/30/1991,"Banner, Lisa R.; Mc Lai, Michael",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(91)90795-d

Full-length (protein product designated A) and C-terminal truncated (protein product designated B) serotype 3 reovirus Sl mRNA transcripts synthesizedin vitro were cotranslated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under conditions which allowed for the identification of oligomeric forms of σl. A total of four oligomeric protein bands (corresponding to A3, A2B1, A1B2, and B3, respectively) was consistently observed, which suggests that the protein is made up of three monomeric subunits. Biophysical characterization of purified σ1 using column filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis confirmed the highly asymmetric shape of σ1 and allowed us to determine the molecular weight of the native protein to be ∼132K (a trimer). Similar biophysical analysis on the two tryptic fragments of the σ1 [N-terminal fibrous tail (26K monomeric molecular weight) and the C-terminal globular head (23K monomeric molecular weight)] yielded molecular weights of 77K and 64K, respectively, both again corresponding to trimers. We therefore conclude that protein σ1 is a homotrimer and provide, with supportive experimental evidence, a rationale for the anomalous behavior of the oligomeric protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which, coupled with chemical cross-linking studies, has in part led to the previous suggestion that σ1 might be a higher order oligomer.",9/30/1991,"Strong, James E.; Leone, Gustavo; Duncan, Roy; Sharma, Rajendra K.; Lee, Patrick W.K.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(91)90818-v

Among surface expressed polypeptides is the 35-kDa antigen, previously designated Ag35. Both monoclonal (mAb) and monospecific affinity pure antibodies directed against Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness, indicating that this prominent surface antigen has a function during early virus-host cell interactions. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to various regions of Ag35 was tested by reacting CNBr fragments, derived from the polypeptide, employing Western blotting. All mAbs tested reacted with the same region of Ag35. Estimation of the molecular weights (MW), based on migration of the CNBr peptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that those partial digestion products which contained a proline-rich 99 amino acid limit digest fragment were present at a position approximately 12.5 kDa larger than that predicted from the DNA sequence. By contrast, partial and limit digest products lacking the proline-rich fragment migrated to the MW position expected from the length of the DNA sequence. This observation demonstrates that departure from a predicted 22.3 kDa to an anomalous MW of Ag35 is conferred by the proline-rich peptide. The surface location of Ag35 was confirmed by immune electron microscopy. In a competition test the binding specificity of mAb and affinity-purified antibodies at the surface of virions could be demonstrated. Evidence for an association of Ag35 with the virus envelope at various stages during biogenesis of vaccinia was obtained by immune electron microscopy of whole mounts and thin sections. Presence of Ag35 as an early component of immature and mature virions, probably residing in the bilayer membrane structure was detected.

Some features of these RNAs suggest that they are similar to defective interfering (DI) RNAs, and would be the first to be reported for the potexvirus group. The prototype 1.2-kb RNA is 1172 nucleotides in length excluding a probable poly(A) tail and is composed of two noncontiguous regions corresponding to 757 nucleotides of the 5′ and 415 nucleotides of the 3′ terminal of CYMV's gRNA. The sequence of the prototype 1.2-kb RNA reveals that the two terminal gRNA regions present in this RNA encode a single open reading frame (ORF) joining the N-terminus of the 191-kDa nonstructural product and the C-terminus of the coat protein to form a 35-kDa 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product. The coding properties of this prototype RNA have been confirmed by translation in vitro of native and synthetic transcripts of the 1.2-kb RNAs, both of which direct the synthesis of the anticipated 35-kDa product which reacts with anti-CYMV antiserum. Three additional 1.2-kb RNA species, each of which contains a unique junction site, have been characterized. In all cases, a fusion ORF encoding a 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product is encoded on the RNA. The presence of a fusion ORF in all members of the 1.2-kb RNA species analyzed suggests that maintenance of this ORF may be important for the survival of this class of RNA within the plant.

In the JHM strain of MHV, expression of the HE gene is variable and corresponds to the number of copies of a UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence present at the 3′-end of the leader RNA. This copy number varies among MHV strains, depending on their passage history. The JHM isolates with two copies of UCUAA in their leader RNA showed a high level of HE expression, whereas the JHM isolate with three copies had a low-level expression. In this study, the analysis of HE gene expression was extended to other MHV strains. The synthesis of HE mRNA in these viruses also correlates with the copy number of UCUAA in the leader RNA and the particular intergenic sequence preceding the HE gene. In one MHV strain, MHV-1, no detectable HE mRNA was synthesized, despite the presence of a proper transcription initiation signal. This lack of HE mRNA expression was consistent with a leader RNA containing three UCUAA copies. However, mutations and deletions within the coding region of the MHV-1 HE gene have generated a stretch of sequence which resembled the transcriptional initiation motif, and was shown to initiate the synthesis of a novel smaller mRNA. These findings strengthened the theory that interactions between leader RNA and transcriptional initiation sequences regulate MHV subgenomic mRNA transcription. Sequence analysis revealed that most MHV strains, through extensive mutations, deletions, or insertions, have lost the complete HE open reading frame, thus turning HE into a pseudogene. This high degree of variation is unusual as the other three structural proteins (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid) are well-maintained. In contrast to bovine coronavirus, which apparently requires HE for viral replication, the HE protein in MHV may be only an accessory protein which is not necessary for viral replication.

During the ribosomal frameshift event, the gag open reading frame is shifted -1 nt to allow in-phase reading of the pol open reading frame. A consensus frameshift signal sequence of GGGAAAC within the gag-pol overlap region of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been identified followed by a sequence that has the potential for a pseudoknot tertiary structure. Using recombinant baculoviruses in which the frameshift occurs efficiently, the consensus sequence has been shown to be the site of the frameshift event. A mutation creating a termination codon just downstream of the putative frameshift signal sequence but upstream of the potential pseudoknot structure made a shorter gag product, but did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting. A mutation creating a termination codon just upstream of the putative frameshift signal made a shorter product and essentially abrogated frameshifting. Mutations in the first stem or the second stem in the potential pseudoknot structure severely reduced the frameshifting efficiency. Mutations which altered the length between the frameshift signal and the pseudoknot structure (the so-called spacer region) also reduced the frameshift efficiency. The insertion of a palindromic sequence, which could form a hairpin structure just upstream of the frameshift signal sequence, also affected the frameshifting. These results support the view that the ribosomal frameshift event in the FIV gag-pol region involves the identified signal sequence and appears to require the precisely positioned downstream sequence and indicated pseudoknot structure for efficient frameshifting.",2/29/1992,"Morikawa, Shigeru; Bishop, David H.L.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(92)90004-9

As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3′ end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3′-M-SH-G-F-5′, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5′ ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5′ end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3'-M-F-5′. The 5′ termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.",2/29/1992,"Yu, Q.; Davis, P.J.; Li, J.; Cavanagh, D.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(92)90007-c

Previous investigations have shown that the MHV spike (S) protein is a critical determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity in mice and rats. To understand the molecular basis of MHV neuropathogenesis, we studied the spike protein gene sequences of several neutralization-resistant variants of the JHM strain of MHV, which were selected with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the S protein. We found that variant 2.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.2.2 and primarily caused demyelination, had a single point mutation at nucleotide (NT) 3340, as compared to the parental JHM virus, which predominantly caused encephalitis. This site was in the S2 subunit of the S protein. In contrast, variant 7.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.7.2 and primarily caused encephalitis, had two point mutations at NT 1766 and 1950, which were in the S1 subunit. Finally, the double mutant 2.2/7.2-V-2, which was selected with both MAbs J.2.2 and J.7.2, and was attenuated with respect to both virulence and the ability to cause demyelination, had a deletion spanning from NT 1523 to 1624 in the S1 and a point mutation at NT 3340 in the S2. We conclude that at least two regions of the S protein contribute to neuropathogenicity of MHV. We have also isolated a partial revertant of 2.2-V-1, which was partially resistant to MAb 1.2.2 but retained the same neuropathogenicity as the variant 2.2-V-1. This revenant retained the mutation at NT 3340, but had a second-site mutation at NT 1994, further confirming that NT 3340 contributed to the pathogenic phenotype of MHV. By comparing these results with MHV variants isolated in other laboratories, which had mutations in other sites on the S gene and yet retained the demyelinating ability, we suggest that the ability of JHM viruses to induce demyelination is determined by the interaction of multiple sites on the S gene, rather than the characteristics of a single, unique site.

This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc γ receptor (FcγR). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcγR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcγR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC.

An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as the putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open reading frame encodes a protein of 424 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in the HE protein of HCV-OC43 while nine of them were present in BRCV-G95. Fourteen cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and the C-terminus may serve as signal peptide and transmembrane anchoring domain, respectively. The predicted HE protein of HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to the HEs of BRCV-G95 and other bovine coronaviruses, and 60% identical to the HEs of mouse hepatitis viruses.

Comparison of the latter two has previously revealed an extra open reading frame (ORF) at the 3′ end of the FIPV genome, lacking in TGEV, which is currently designated ORF 6b. Both CCV and FECV possess 6b-related ORFs at the 3′ ends of their genomes. The presence of ORF 6b in three of four viruses in this antigenic cluster strongly suggests that TGEV has lost this ORF by deletion. The CCV ORF 6b is collinear with that of FIPV, but the predicted amino acid sequences are only 58% identical. The FECV ORF 6b contains a large deletion compared to that of FIPV, reducing the collinear part to 60%. The sequence homologies were highest between CCV and TGEV on the one hand and between FECV and FIPV on the other.

The predicted common structural elements occur in the 3′ end of a segment that is critical for internal ribosome binding, termed “ribosome landing pad” (RLP), of polioviruses. Base pairings between highly conserved 17-nucleotide (nt) and 21-nt sequences in the 5′ UTR of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses constitute a predicted pseudoknot that is significantly more stable than those that can be formed from a large set of randomly shuffled sequences. A conserved single-stranded polypyrimidine tract is located between two conserved tertiary elements. R. Nicholson, J. Pelletier, S.-Y. Le, and N. Sonenberg (1991, J. Virol. 65, 5886–5894) demonstrated that the point mutations of 3-nt UUU out of an essential 4-nt pyrimidine stretch sequence UUUC abolished translation. Structural analysis of the mutant sequence indicates that small point mutations within the short polypyrimidine sequence would destroy the tertiary interaction in the predicted, highly ordered structure. The proposed common tertiary structure can offer experimentalists a model upon which to extend the interpretations for currently available data. Based on these structural features possible base-pairing models between human enteroviruses and 18 S rRNA and between human rhinoviruses and 18 S rRNA are proposed.

Viruses purified from supernatants of ammonium chloride-treated cells contained prM protein and were unable to fuse C6/36 mosquito cells from without. When ammonium chloride was removed from the cells, both the processing of prM and the fusion activity of the purified viruses were partially restored. By using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the envelope (E) glycoprotein of MVE virus, we found that at least three epitopes were less accessible to their corresponding antibodies in the prM-containing MVE virus particles. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of the E protein which were reactive with sequence-specific peptide antisera or MAb enabled us to estimate the site of the E protein interacting with the prM to be within amino acids 200 to 327.

Here we have performed a mutagenic analysis to identify the active site residues of this proteinase. Substitution of other amino acids for either Cys-481 or His-558 completely abolished proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins in vitro. Substitutions within this domain for a second cysteine conserved among alphaviruses, for four other conserved histidines, or for a conserved serine did not affect the activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that nsP2 is a papain-like proteinase whose catalytic dyad is composed of Cys-481 and His-558. Since an asparagine residue has been implicated in the active site of papain, we changed the four conserved asparagine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2 and found that all could be substituted without total loss of activity. Among papain-like proteinases, the residue following the catalytic histidine is alanine or glycine in the plant and animal enzymes, and the presence of Trp-559 in alphaviruses is unusual. A mutant enzyme containing Ala-559 was completely inactive, implying that Trp-559 is essential for a functional proteinase. All of these mutations were introduced into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro, and the effects of these changes on viability were tested. In all cases it was found that mutations which abolished proteolytic activity were lethal, whether or not these mutations were in the catalytic residues, indicating that proteolysis of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication.",12/31/1992,"Strauss, Ellen G.; De Groot, Raoul J.; Levinson, Randy; Strauss, James H.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(92)90268-t

The neuronal nuclei infected and the spread of virus within the brain are described. The main difference between the parental and variant viruses was the rate at which the infection spread. MHV-4 spread rapidly, destroying large numbers of neurons and the animals died within 4 days of infection. The variant virus spread to the same areas of the brain but at a slower rate. This difference in the rate of virus spread was also apparent from the brain virus titers. The slower rate of spread of the variant virus appears to allow intervention by the immune response. Consistent with this, the variant virus spread slowly in athymic nu/nu mice, but in the absence of an intact immune response, infection and destruction of neurons eventually reached the same extent as that of the parental virus and the mice died within 6 days of infection.

Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the 10K recombinant product immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of a similar size in TGEV-infected cells. Immunofluorescence assays performed both on insect and mammalian cells revealed that ORF4 was a membrane-associated protein, a finding consistent with the prediction of a membrane-spanning segment in ORF4 sequence. Two epitopes were localized within the last 21 C-terminal residues of the sequence through peptide scanning and analysis of the reactivity of a truncated ORF4 recombinant protein. Since the relevant MAbs were found to induce a cell surface fluorescence, these data suggest that ORF4 may be an integral membrane protein having a Cexo-Nendo orientation.

Comparison of amino acid sequence data provided strong evidence that other coronaviruses encode a polypeptide homologous to TGEV ORF4.

The binding activity of IBV was not sufficient to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. However, it acquired hemagglutinating activity after treatment with neuraminidase to remove α2,3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid from the surface of the virion. Pretreatment of erythrocytes with neuraminidase rendered the cells resistant to agglutination by IBV. Susceptibility to agglutination was restored by resialylation of asialo-erythrocytes to contain α2,3-linked sialic acid. These results indicate that IBV attaches to receptors on erythrocytes, the crucial determinant of which is sialic acid α2,3-linked to galactose.

Temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated using 5-fluorouracil and 5-azacytidine as mutagen. Six RNA+ mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the S glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature. Using standard genetic techniques, a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated F1 and F2. These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the S1 and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1 % per 575–676 by was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (>50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination.

For this purpose, we established four types of cell lines (referred to as G(Gln)-NA, G(Arg)-NA, G(Gln)-BHK, and G(Arg)-BHK cells, respectively) by transfecting either the G(Gln)-cDNA or G(Arg)-cDNA into two kinds of cells, murine neuroblastoma C1300 (clone NA) and nonneuronal BHK-21. Both G(Gln)-NA and G(Arg)-NA cells produced G proteins when they were treated with 5 mM sodium butyrate, but only G(Arg)-NA cells formed syncytia at the neutral pH, which was suppressed by anti-G antiserum. The sodium butyrate-treated G(Arg)-NA cells fused also with sodium butyrate-treated NA cells under coculture conditions, but neither with untreated NA cells nor with BHK-21 cells. On the other hand, both G(Gln)-BHK and G(Arg)-BHK cells constitutively produced G proteins, but no syncytium was produced at the neutral pH. G(Arg)-BHK cells, however, formed syncytia with the sodium butyrate-treated NA cells when they were cocultured. These results suggest that only G(Arg) has a potential ability to produce syncytia of NA cells regardless of cell types by which G(Arg) protein was produced and also suggest that a certain cellular factor(s) is required for the syncytium formation, the factor(s) which is lacking in BHK-21 and untreated NA cells but is produced by the sodium butyrate-treated NA cells.",7/31/1992,"Morimoto, Kinjiro; Ni, Ya-Jin; Kawai, Akihiko",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(92)90696-m

Efforts at understanding the components of the immune response in the development of chronic MHV-induced demyelination have implicated the antibody response and both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. In this report, we demonstrate that Balb/c (H-2°) mice immunized with the JHM (JHMV) strain of MHV develop a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. One population of these virus-specific CTL recognize the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing either the entire N protein or carboxy-terminal deletions were used to determine the number and location of the epitope(s) recognized. The CTLs were found to recognize a peptide contained within the carboxy-terminal 149 amino acids of the N protein. Analysis of infected cell lines expressing transfected major histocompatibility genes demonstrated that the anti-N protein CTLs were restricted exclusively to the L° molecule.

These included the previously identified N-terminal ORF 1a product, p28, as well as 290-, 240-, and 50-kDa polypeptides. P28 was always detected as a discrete band without larger precursors, suggesting rapid cleavage of p28 immediately after its synthesis. Once p28 was cleaved there was little degradation of the protein over a 2-hr period. The intracellular cleavage of p28 was not inhibited by the protease inhibitor leupeptin, in contrast to results obtained during in vitro translation of genome RNA (Denison and Perlman, 1986). These data suggest that different protease activities may be responsible for the cleavage of p28 in vitro and in vivo. The 290-kDa protein was an intermediate cleavage product derived from a precursor of greater than 400 kDa. The 290-kDa product was subsequently cleaved into secondary products of 50 and 240 kDa. The intracellular cleavage of the 290-kDa polypeptide was inhibited by leupeptin at concentrations which did not inhibit the early cleavage of p28 or the cleavage of the 290-kDa product from its larger polyprotein precursor. In the presence of zinc chloride, a product of >320 kDa was detected, which appears to incorporate p28 at its amino terminus. This suggests that at least two protease activities may be necessary for processing of ORF1a proteins, one of which cleaves p28 and is sensitive to zinc chloride but resistant to leupeptin, and the other which cleaves the 290-kDa precursor and is sensitive to both inhibitors. Both the 290- and 240-kDa proteins should contain sequences predicted to encode two papain-like protease activities.",7/31/1992,"Denison, Mark R.; Zoltick, Philip W.; Hughes, Scott A.; Giangreco, Bernadette; Olson, Ann L.; Perlman, Stanley; Leibowitz, Julian L.; Weiss, Susan R.",Virology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(92)90703-r

The mutant was able to grow in a subline of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK II) which is resistant to infection by the parent virus due to a lack of receptors. Inactivation of cellular receptors by either neuraminidase or acetylesterase and generation of receptors by resialylation of cells with N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) indicated that 9-O-acetylated sialic acid is a receptor determinant for both parent and mutant virus. However, the mutant required less Neu5,9Ac2 on the cell surface for virus attachment than the parent virus. The increased binding efficiency enabled the mutant to infect cells with a low content of 9-O-acetylated sialic acid which were resistant to the parent virus. By comparing the nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein (HEF) genes of the parent and the mutant virus only a single point mutation could be identified on the mutant gene. This mutation at nucleotide position 872 causes an amino acid exchange from threonine to isoleucine at position 284 on the amino acid sequence.

To identify the regions recognized by MAbs, DNA fragments derived from the N-coding region of the TGEV strain FS772/70 were cloned into pUR expression plasmids and the antigenicity of the resulting fusion proteins was analyzed by immunobloting. A major antigenic domain was identified, covering the first 241 amino acid residues of N, within which an epitope (residues 57–117) was also found. A second antigenic domain extended from residues 175 to 360 of the nucleoprotein, within which a subsite was characterized within the region covering residues 241–349. MAb DA3 recognized a linear epitope which mapped within residues 360 and 382 at the carboxy terminus of the nucleoprotein. The binding of the majority of the MAbs (8 out of 11) to large fusions, but not to smaller fragments included in them, suggests a conformational dependence of the MAb binding sites.

Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells.

Nonenteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) have been derived from TGEV. The genetic relationship among six European PRCVs and five coronaviruses of the TGEV antigenic cluster has been determined based on their RNA sequences. The S protein of six PRCVs have an identical deletion of 224 amino acids starting at position 21. The deleted area includes the antigenic sites C and B of TGEV S glycoprotein. Interestingly, two viruses (NEB72 and TOY56) with respiratory tropism have S proteins with a size similar to the enteric viruses. NEB72 and TOY56 viruses have in the S protein 2 and 15 specific amino acid differences with the enteric viruses. Four of the residues changed (aa 219 of NEB72 isolate and as 92, 94, and 218 of TOY56) are located within the deletion present in the PRCVs and may be involved in the receptor binding site (RBS) conferring enteric tropism to TGEVs. A second RBS used by the virus to infect ST cells might be located in a conserved area between sites A and D of the S glycoprotein, since monoclonal antibodies specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST cells. An evolutionary tree relating 13 enteric and respiratory isolates has been proposed. According to this tree, a main virus lineage evolved from a recent progenitor virus which was circulating around 1941. From this, secondary lineages originated PUR46, NEB72, TOY56, MIL65, BR170, and the PRCVs, in this order. Least squares estimation of the origin of TGEV-related coronaviruses showed a significant constancy in the fixation of mutations with time, that is, the existence of a well-defined molecular clock. A mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions per site and per year was calculated for TGEV-related viruses. This rate falls in the range reported for other RNA viruses.

This processing step was significantly less efficient in insect cells than the analogous step in mammalian cells, even though the cleavage sites of authentic and recombinant gl were shown to be identical.

Despite the reduced cleavage and altered glycosylation, the recombinant glycoprotein was transported and expressed on the surface of infected insect cells. These surface molecules were biologically active as demonstrated by their ability to induce cell-cell fusion. Fusion was inhibited bythree monoclonal antibodies specific for antigenic domains I and IV on gl.

OC-induced immunosuppression has been repeatedly demonstrated in a wide variety of animal species. Therefore, it is probable that the immune functions of St. Lawrence beluga whales are impaired. Benzo[α]pyrene adducts were detected in 10 of the 11 St. Lawrence beluga whales of which tissues (six livers, 10/11 brains) were analyzed by a method based on HPLC. No such adducts were found in four Arctic animals. Since benzo[α]pyrene is one of the most potent chemical carcinogens known to man, these compounds might be responsible for some of the cancers observed in that population. Overall, our findings contrast vividly with those of others who found that cancers are exceedingly rare in free-ranging odontocete populations and that the major causes for mortalities in these populations are bacteria, parasites, and trauma.",9/16/1994,"Martineau, D.; De Guise, S.; Fournier, M.; Shugart, L.; Girard, C.; Lagacé, A.; Béland, P.",Science of The Total Environment,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(94)90088-4

The hazards stem from chemical and microbiological agents whose nature and magnitude depend heavily on the degree of sorting and on the composting methods. Three main routes of exposure can be determined and are quantified in the literature: (i) The ingestion of soil/compost mixtures by children, mostly in cases of pica, can be a threat because of the amount of lead, chromium, cadmium, PCDD F and fecal streptococci that can be absorbed. (ii) Though concern about contamination through the food chain is weak when compost is used in agriculture, some authors anticipate accumulation of pollutants after several years of disposal, which might lead to future hazards. (iii) Exposure is also associated with atmospheric dispersion of compost organic dust that convey microorganisms and toxicants. Data on hazard posed by organic dust from municipal composts to the farmer or the private user is scarce. To date, microorganisms are only measured at composting plants, thus raising the issue of extrapolation to environmental situations. Lung damage and allergies may occur because of organic dust, Gram negative bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi.

Serine peptidases are found in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes. They include exopeptidases, endopeptidases, oligopeptidases, and omega peptidases. On the basis of three-dimensional structures, most of the serine peptidase families can be grouped together into about six clans that may have common ancestors. The structures are known for members of four of the clans, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidase C, and Escherichia D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase A. The peptidases of chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and carboxypeptidase C clans have a common “catalytic triad” of three amino acids—namely, serine (nucleophile), aspartate (electrophile), and histidine (base). The geometric orientations of these are closely similar between families; however the protein folds are quite different. The arrangements of the catalytic residues in the linear sequences of members of the various families commonly reflect their relationships at the clan level. The members of the chymotrypsin family are almost entirely confined to animals. 10 families are included in chymotrypsin clan (SA), and all the active members of these families are endopeptidases. The order of catalytic residues in the polypeptide chain in clan SA is His/Asp/Ser.",12/31/1994,"Rawlings, Neil D.; Barrett, Alan J.",Methods in Enzymology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0076-6879(94)44004-2

Although the prevalence of the disease is moderately low, averaging about 40 cases per 100,000 people in high risk areas, it is a particularly devastating disease. It primarily affects young adults, is chronic, and has an unpredictable course. Most discouraging, the cause of the disease is not known and an effective treatment has not been identified. Recently, however, research has yielded some important findings concerning the etiology of MS. Much evidence now points to an immunological process as one of the major elements in the disease. It is also likely that an environmental influence, possibly an infectious process, may contribute to the disease. Finally, it is now certain that genetic makeup influences susceptibility to the disease. At present, the strongest evidence is for a polygenic effect, not the effect of a single gene or gene locus. This review will examine some of the possible immunologically mediated disease processes that could be involved in MS, especially those that could account for a role for infectious and genetic factors in the disease.",1/31/1989,"McFarland, Henry F.; Dhib-Jalbut, Suhayl",Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0090-1229(89)90116-5

Simultaneously, and at each dose of cocaine, unconditioned psychomotor stimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied in terms of multiple concurrent measures of spontaneous behavior and by activity patterns of locomotion. Time course studies showed that the neurochemical effects of cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.001) increased accumbens synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and concurrently and significantly (p<0.0001) decreased accumbens synaptic concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) in a dose response manner. Simulataneous behavioral time course studies showed that cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.0001) increased ambulations (locomotor activity), fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming) and rearing behavior, while significantly decreasing agoraphobic behavior, as measured by a statistically significant increase in central ambulations (p<0.0001). The high dose of cocaine (40 mg/kg SC) significantly increased fine movements over those produced by the lower doses of cocaine (p<0.0002). One import of the findings is that the DA and 5-HT biogenic amine response occurs in a behavioral paradigm of psychomotor stimulation, which is a known measure of reinforcement. Another is that the biogenic amines DA and 5-HT are affected by cocaine in this reinforcement paradigm with exactly opposite directionality. Finally, acute cocaine administration is shown to produce a dose response inhibition of agoraphobia (fear),w hich is highly correlated (ϱ=.983, p<0.01) with the opposing effects of cocaine on the accumbens biogenic amines, DA and 5-HT.",12/31/1991,"Broderick, Patricia A.",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0091-3057(91)90112-f

The results were compared with cocaine effects on accumbens DA and 5-HT in the freely moving rat, without γ-BL treatment. A neurochemical time course profile showed that the cocaine-induced increase in accumbens synaptic concentrations of DA was significantly blocked (p<0.0001) after DA impulse flow was significantly inhibited (p<0.0038) by γ-BL (35.8%).

The findings show that cocaine's effects on synaptic concentrations for DA and for HT in accumbens are dependent on neuronal impulse flow.

The actual detection of the biogenic amines was on-line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Simultaneously, the psychostimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied by infrared photocell beam detection. The results show that cocaine concurrently and significantly increased synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT (p < 0.004) in VTA. Serotonin changes were accompanied by a notable oscillatory pattern. Importantly, DA and 5-HT changes in VTA were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). Moreover, psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine were significantly increased over control values (p < 0.0001). Psychostimulant behaviors were significantly correlated with concurrently changing synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.01) and also with 5-HT to a lesser degree. Additionally, behavioral data indicate that cocaine may exhibit an anxiolytic effect during acute administration because agoraphobic behavior, as shown by increased central ambulatory behavior, was dramatically reduced by cocaine. Summarily, the present findings show that cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of DA in VTA, an action that is correlated with cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior. The DA-ergic effect appears to be tonically maintained. Furthermore, new findings demonstrate a colocalized, cocaine induced 5-HT-ergic effect in VTA, which keeps pace with cocaine-induced alterations in DA-ergic neurotransmission.

In further in vivo voltammetric studies, the effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were studied in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm in two neuroanatomic substrates, NAcc and mesoaccumbens somatodendrites, the ventral tegmental area (VTA-A10), in a dose-response fashion (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in six separate studies. Moreover, in two additional in vivo voltammetric studies, again using the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm, the impulse flow blocker, γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) (750 mg/kg, IP), was studied alone and in combination with SC cocaine (20 mg/kg) to determine whether or not cocaine can act by presynaptic releasing mechanisms for DA and 5-HT. The results show that IV cocaine concurrently and significantly increased DA and 5-HT release in the NAcc (p < 0.001, p < 0.0005, respectively) at both doses tested. Moreover, IV cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). On the other hand, SC cocaine concurrently and significantly decreased DA and 5-HT release in NAcc (p < 0.0001) and VTA (p < 0.0001) at each separate dose tested. SC cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated across dose and neuroanatomic substrate (p < 0.01).

Miniature stearate probes detected DA and 5-HT release, on line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Psychostimulant behaviors, in the form of four behavioral components (i.e., the classically DA-dependent behaviors of locomotor activity [ambulations], rearing, and stereotypy, and a 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations) were studied concurrently with infrared photobeam detection. The results show that (IP) cocaine significantly increased vlNAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT release (p < 0.0012). Each of the four parameters of cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior was concurrently and significantly increased as well (ambulations: p < 0.0001; rearing: p < 0.0008; stereotypy: p < 0.0004; central ambulations: p < 0.0082). Moreover, exactly coincident data points for DA and 5-HT release occurred 10 and 40 min after (IP) cocaine administration. Cocaine-induced DA and 5-HT release were highly and positively correlated during the first hour of study (p < 0.01). As expected, increased DA release in vlNAcc after cocaine administration was significantly and positively correlated with classically DA-dependent behaviors (first- and second-hour effects) (p < 0.01) and with the 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations (p < 0.01). Also, cocaine-induced 5-HT release was significantly and positively correlated with 5-HT behavior (p < 0.01). However, not as expected, classically DA-dependent behaviors were more positively correlated with cocaine-induced 5-HT release in vlNAcc throughout the two-hour period of study.

The behavioral parameters were: a) locomotor activity (ambulations), b) rearing, c) stereotypy (fine movements, primarily grooming), and d) agoraphobia [(thigmotaxis) a natural tendency to avoid the center of the behavioral chamber]. With each behavioral data point, dopamine (DA) release, and serotonin (5-HT) release were detected within seconds in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the same behaving male Sprague-Dawley rats, using in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Ibogaine was administered (40 mg/kg IP) for 4 consecutive days. Importantly, the DAergic and the 5-HTergic responses to (SC) cocaine and two behavioral responses, ambulations and central ambulations, were reduced in intensity due to extended time spent in the novel behavioral chamber (habituated). Rearing and fine movement patterns were not habituated. The results show that ibogaine downmodulated the (SC) cocaine-induced increase in NAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and potentiated the (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in NAcc 5-HT release (p < 0.0001). Concurrently, ibogaine downmodulated cocaine-induced ambulation (p < 0.0001) and central ambulation behavior (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the behavioral parameters that did not exhibit habituation, i.e., rearing behavior and fine movement behavior, were not downmodulated by ibogaine (p < 0.1558) (p < 0.3763), respectively. Furthermore, ibogaine itself did not significantly alter NAcc DA release over the 2-h period studied (p < 0.9113) although individual time points were significantly affected bidirectionally. Concurrently ibogaine significantly increased 5-HT release (p < 0.0155). Behaviorally, ibogaine appears to be a weak psychostimulant.

Clearly, allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma.

Most histamine release occurred during the first 15 to 30 minutes after challenge, depending on the dose of virus used; release initiated by virus was complete by 1 hour. At a virus/cell ratio of 1:1, Sendai virus caused 41 ± 9% histamine release, whereas parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) virus caused 25 ± 5% release and respiratory syncytial (RS) virus caused 19 ± 5% release. Sendai, but not PI-3 or RS, also caused a decrease in cell number and release of lactic dehydrogenase; however, this apparent cell lysis did not account for all the histamine released. Incubation of cells with virus desensitized them to subsequent triggering by viruses but did not affect response of cells to other stimuli. Histamine release was dependent on the virus/cell ratio, temperature, and metabolic energy, but it was not strictly dependent on the presence of calcium in the extracellular medium. Histamine release was not affected by preincubation of cells with colchicine, suggesting that microtubules were not involved in the release process. Basophils desensitized by anti-IgE in the absence of calcium or treated with lactic acid to dissociate IgE molecules from membrane receptors released amounts of histamine similar to that of control basophils; thus, release was not initiated through Fcϵ receptors. It was found, however, that histamine release by these viruses was greatly reduced when concanavalin A was used for desensitization. These data demonstrate that the respiratory viruses studied can cause direct nonimmunologic release of histamine from human basophils.

Before challenge and on each of 6 days of cloister, all volunteers were interviewed for symptoms and completed a test battery consisting of evaluations of secretion production by weighed tissues, nasal patency by active posterior rhinomanometry, nasal clearance by the dyed saccharin technique, pulmonary function by spirometry, eustachian tube function by sonotubometry, and middle ear status by tympanometry. The symptomatology and pathophysiology resulting from the rhinovirus infection were consistent with those reported in previous studies with this challenge system. Between-group comparisons revealed no differences in symptom presentation, nasal secretion production, or overall pathophysiologic response.

This was most evident in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with JHM. Such CNS lesions were not observed in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with the MHV3 strain. An in vitro system is described in which the rat glial RN2 cell line functions as a discriminating host for the JHM virus. Shortly after inoculation, this virus establishes a persistent infection in which there is a cyclical rise and fall in titer with an accompanying cytopathology. Furthermore, this host cell confers a thermal lability which the virus does not demonstrate in the fully permissive host cell, L-2. By comparison, infection of RN2 cells with the prototype MHV3 is aborted immediately. In the persistent infection of RN2 cells with measles virus, Hallé strain, the cell again confers a temperature sensitivity which the virus does not possess when replicating in Vero cells. This appears to be the first instance in which a cloned cell line of glial origin determines the outcome of the infectious process, discriminating in favor of a neurotropic variant which possesses a tropism for the glia in vivo.

Translational bypass of this sequence by elongating ribosomes has been postulated for the mode of synthesis of an 18 kd polypeptide specified by the split coding segments. Ribosome bypass of the untranslated region also occurs when a segment of gene 60 is fused to lacZ and expressed in E. coli. The efficiency of bypass in these gene 60-lacZ fusions approaches 100%. Here, mutations that delete, insert, or substitute nucleotides from gene 60-lacZ fusions are examined.

We previously demonstrated that a 14 nucleotide sequence conserved between two families of Ty elements was necessary and sufficient to support ribosomal frameshifting. This work demonstrates that only 7 of these 14 nucleotides are needed for normal levels of frameshifting. Any change to the sequence CUU-AGG-C drastically reduces frameshifting; this suggests that two specific tRNAs, tRNALeu UAG and tRNAArg CCU, are involved in the event. Our tRNA overproduction data suggest that a leucyl-tRNA, probably tRNALeu UAG, an unusual leucine isoacceptor that recognizes all six leucine codons, slips from CUU-Leu onto UUA-Leu (in the +1 reading frame) during a translational pause at the AGG-Arg codon induced by the low availability of tRNAArg CCU, encoded by a single-copy essential gene.

When either human ERD-2 or a novel human homolog (referred to as ELP-1) is overexpressed in a variety of cell types, the effects are phenotypically indistinguishable from the addition of BFA. These include the redistribution of the Golgi coat protein, β-COP, to the cytosol, the loss of the Golgi apparatus as a distinct organelle, the mixing of this organelle with the ER, the addition of complex oligosaccharides to resident ER glycoproteins, and the block of anterograde traffic.

Cytological examination of vaginal smears was of no diagnostic value in confirming infection in inapparently infected cats. Bacteriological responses after primary or secondary challenge with the CEM organism were essentially similar, with one exception, a female cat in which there was possible evidence of local immunity persisting after the primary infection. Efforts to reactivate shedding subsequent to the immediate post-challenge period were unsuccessful. Throughout the experimental period, the cats remained sero-negative to the complement-fixation test, and they failed to develop any significant increase in the levels of antibody activity as measured by the kinetics-based ELISA or KELA system. On day 89 after primary challenge, the cats were euthanized and various sites in the genitourinary tract and the internal iliac lymphatic glands subjected to bacteriological and pathological examination for evidence of CEM infection with negative results.

The POLI-IF (Newcastle virus plus endotoxin of E. coli and Freund's incomplete adjuvant) rapidly induces the aspecific immunity. Given twice with 7–10 days interval in between, on occasion of a programmed stress (weaning, transport, crowding) it proved its efficacy in artificially suckled calves and in weaning piglets. The field trials, carried out on 2,782 treated calves in comparison with 2,909 untreated controls and on 4,387 piglets in comparison with 4,461 untreated controls, revealed statistically significant differences for P < 0.005 among the groups of treated and control animals. The immunostimulator reduced the incidence of the disease, dead and discarded animals, as well as it shortened the mean duration of the disease in single heads. Though the way the POLI-IF acts is not perfectly known so far, yet it increases the serum bactericidal activity and the circulating leukocytes, while it induces high levels of IFN.

Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental infection induced by three rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts, i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits, respectively. When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian, porcine and rabbit origin were compared by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically to the bovine strain. On the other hand, a reciprocal antigenic correlation was found between bovine and rabbit isolates.

Abstract Pathological consequences of a severe outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1 virus) in the non immune sow at the beginning of pregnancy, under natural conditions. A sudden acute outbreak of fever, depression, anorexia and coughing in a group of nulliparous sows from a herd that was currently under epidemiological investigation lead to build a particular disposal of observation. The clinical signs were daily recorded including rectal temperature. Blood was taken from the sows at the beginning of the troubles and 3 weeks later for the detection of Aujesky's disease, coronavirus TGE-like, Influenza viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Viral detection was attempted from nasal swabs and aborted fetuses during the acute phase. The clinical study showed fever reaching near 41°C on most of the pigs and lasting usually from 2 to 5 days. The diagnosis of Influenza (virus swine H1N1) was established both on serology (massive seroconversion) and on the detection of the virus from the nasal swabs and from an aborted fetus. The control of the lungs of sows “not in pig” and culled showed extended lesions of bronchopneumonia and Pasteurella multocida was found. The technical consequences of this severe outbreak of Influenza on reproduction were mainly important at the beginning of pregnancy. Over 13 sows inseminated less than 1 week before the outbreak, only 3 farrowed (respectively 5,5 and 12 piglets); 7 returned to oestrus and 3 “not a pig” at 21 days (echotomography) did not show signs of heat and were culled. Over 8 pregnant sows (1 month of pregnancy), 6 farrowed normal litters and total embryonic resorption occurred in 2 sows.

It was indispensable for generating coronavirus-specific ELISA antibody activities that the sample was applied to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cells in parallel with the CCV-infected cells and then the optical density values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen. On the basis of ELISA antibody titers obtained in sera from the cats experimentally infected with CCV and from the spontaneous feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) cases, the ELISA described in the present study was found to be applicable as a simple and easy serologic test which was able to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies as efficiently as the indirect immunofluorescence assay with homologous FIP virus.",12/31/1989,"Mochizuki, Masami; Furukawa, Hisashi","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0147-9571(89)90062-3

Digestive disorders connected with BHV1 are in general only observed in calves and mainly in Belgium. Virus strains causing abortion or encephalitis are only present in a few countries. The same is true for BHV1 induced mastitis. Dermatitis and lesions in the interdigital space seem to be a rare event. BHV1 infections are frequently complicated by bacterial secondary infections, but there is evidence that BHV1 infections can occur simultaneously with bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) and/or parainfluenza-3 (PI 3) virus. The biggest problem associated with BHV1 infection is the ability of the agent to become latent following a primary infection. The genome of the virus probably remains during the life of the animal in the ganglia of the region where the primary infection occurred. No vaccination can overcome this latent stage. By prophylactic vaccination it is possible to prevent an outbreak of clinical disease but it is impossible to prevent infection followed by the establishment of latency.

Five PRV strains were used to infect AM including strains that are known to be highly virulent for pigs, i.e. strain 4892 and strain S-62 as well as strains that are regarded as mild or nonvirulent, i.e. BUK and Bartha. The multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.005 to 0.05 TCID50/cell. The target cells in the cytotoxicity assays were either chicken red blood cells, PRV-infected vero cells, or human myeloblastoma cells (K562 cell line). For the producton of IFN, AM cultures were treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) diluted in tissue culture media at a concentration of 5 μg/106 cells. Culture supernatants were collected at various times poststimulation and tested for antiviral activity using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replication inhibition test. Swine AM were able to lyse chicken red blood cells in an antibody-independent way but not in an antibody-dependent way, whereas lysis of PRV-infected vero cells was accomplished both ways. The cytotoxicity against chicken red blood cells was reduced in the PRV-infected AM as compared to noninfected cells, particularly in AM infected with virulent PRV strains. Specific 51Cr release values for AM infected with S-62 and 4892 strains were 14 and 19, while the noninfected AM had values of 36. Similarly, in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay against PRV-infected vero cells there was no activity of AM against K562 cells. The production of IFN was readily stimulated with Poly I:C. The optimal time for supernatant collection was between 12 and 16h poststimulation. The antiviral activity was abrogated by treatment of the supernatant with antiserum against human leukocyte IFN; it was therefore considered to be due to interferon-alpha (IFNα) released from the macrophages. The antiviral activity present in supernatants of PRV-infected AM was reduced compared to noninfected AM. The difference between AM cultures infected with virulent strains of PRV and noninfected AM cultures was statistically significant at P ⩽ 0.025.

Following a 15-min period of viral aerosol stabilization, sequential samples of drum air were collected using an All-Glass Impinger (AGI) for 24 h post-aerosolization. Both of the rotavirus isolates were found to survive best at medium RH level and high RH was found least favorable for the survival of these aerosolized rotaviruses. The survival pattern of aerosolized MRV was found to be the best when compared with survival pattern of all animal and human rotavirus isolates studies performed under aerosolized conditions in our laboratory. The findings of these experiments confirm and extend our previous reports on the survival of other animal and human aerosolized rotaviruses and emphasize the fact that air may be one of the vehicles for their dissemination and could explain why it is difficult to control nosocomial outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis and to keep animal colonies rotavirus-free.",5/31/1994,"Ijaz, M.K.; Sattar, S.A.; Alkarmi, T.; Dar, F.K.; Bhatti, A.R.; Elhag, K.M.","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0147-9571(94)90034-5

A comparison of the carboxypeptidase digests of the MRV- and BRV-VP4 revealed an area of variability between amino acids 307 and 407, which may represent a site of virulence determinant. Under in vivo conditions the virulence of both parenteral BRV and MRV isolates and their corresponding reassortants (with replaced gene 4) were studied in murine and bovine hosts.

Spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum were found to be immunologically distinct; the highest anti-BCV antibody responses were detected in spiral colon, the primary site of infection, and involved all four isotypes of bovine immunoglobulins. The antibody response in ileum was lower than in spiral colon.

Methods: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (1966–August 2004) and InternationalPharmaceutical Abstracts (1970–August 2004) databases with the search terms daptomycin, LY146032, and lipopeptide antibiotics. Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and documents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration were also reviewed. Results: Phase III study results suggest no difference in efficacy or tolerability between daptomycin 4 mg/kgIV QD and vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillins for complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneumonia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatment It is available as an IV medication and exhibits 92% plasma protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptomycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of ∼9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (∼54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours. No dosage adjustment appears to be necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been assessed. The most commonly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea. Patients should also be monitored regularly for skeletal muscle toxicity. Conclusions: Daptomycin may be useful for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and gram-positive pathogens resistant to conventional antimicrobials.

The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the 1162-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies. This clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes, one of which has been localized within 18 residues. The epitopes found as antigenic pEX expression products do not coincide with the regions in the S1 subunit that have been found to contain hypervariable sequences.

Liver microcirculation has a unique design that allows very efficient exchange processes between plasma and liver cells, even when severe constraints are imposed upon the system, i.e. in stressful situations. Furthermore, it has been recognized recently that sinusoids and their associated cells can no longer be considered only as passive structures ensuring the dispersion of molecules in the liver, but represent a very sophisticated network that protects and regulates parenchymal cells through a variety of mediators. Finally, vascular abnormalities are a prominent feature of a number of liver pathological processes, including cirrhosis and liver cell necrosis whether induced by alcohol, ischemia, endotoxins, virus or chemicals. Although it is not clear whether vascular lesions can be the primary events that lead to hepatocyte injury, the main interest of these findings is that liver microcirculation could represent a potential target for drug action in these conditions.",12/31/1990,"Ballet, François",Pharmacology & Therapeutics,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0163-7258(90)90091-f

The liver has emerged as the major organ participating in the degradation and elimination of arachidonate products of systemic origin. The synthesis in the liver of arachidonate products derived from the cfyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 system pathways has been demonstrated. The participation of leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl-leukotrienes as mediators of liver damage and the possible therapeutic usefulness of prostaglandins (PGs) in acute liver injury has attracted the interest of clinicians. This article reviews the essential features regarding the role of arachidonate metabolites in liver disease and specially focuses on the cytoprotective effects on the liver displayed by PGE2, PGE1, PGI2 and synthetic PG analogs in experimental models of liver damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury, carbon tetrachloride, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and viral hepatitis and on the possible mechanisms underlying liver cytoprotection in these experimental models.

There is now considerable data on the cells and factors involved in fetal resorption but little is known about the events which activate this process. While the activation of the maternal response to the fetal implant could have endogenous or genetic origins, a role for exogenous factors including microbial pathogens could also be involved. In order to investigate these possibilities, the reproductive success of CBA/j♀ × DBA/2j♂ matings in a conventional animal care facility were compared with matings in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility. All animals housed under these conditions were routinely screened by immunoassay and culture, for the presence of a number of viral and bacterial pathogens of mice. The incidence of spontaneous embryo loss in specific pathogen free CBA female mice mated by DBA and other male strains was found to be virtually identical to that of CBA female mice infected with multiple viral pathogens and housed under otherwise identical conditions (non-SPF). However, the numbers of implantation per pregnancy was significantly greater in an SPF facility. Therefore, exposure of mating mice to exogenous viral and bacterial pathogens did not appear to alter the overall incidence of spontaneous embryo resorption.

In addition, sera of VN-positive and VN-negative neonatal pigs were analyzed for immunoglobulin classes by radial immunodiffusion technique. The competence of neonatal pigs to produce VN antibody with increased IgG levels was demonstrated.

Monoclonal antibodies to bovine immunoglobulin isotypes of proven specificity were used as conjugated or catching antibody. Five days after oral inoculation (dpi) of a 5-day-old gnotobiotic calf with rotavirus, IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted in faeces, followed 5 days later by IgA rotavirus antibodies. The increase in IgM rotavirus antibody titre coincided with the inability to detect further rotavirus excretion. Faeces IgM and IgA rotavirus antibody titres fell to low levels within 3 weeks post infection. IgG1 and IgG2 rotavirus antibodies were not detected in faecal samples. In serum, antibodies to rotavirus of all four isotypes were detected, starting with IgM at 5 dpi. Two SPF-calves, which were fed colostrum free of rotavirus antibodies, were vaccinated with a modified live rotavirus vaccine and challenged with virulent rotavirus 6 days later. Upon vaccination, the calves showed an antibody response similar to the response of the infected gnotobiotic calf. Intestinal IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted before or on the day of challenge and appeared to be associated with protection against challenge infection with virulent virus and rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. In 3 control calves, which were challenged only, the antibody patterns also resembled that of the gnotobiotic calf and again the appearance of IgM rotavirus antibodies coincided with the end of the rotavirus detection period. Two other groups of 3 SPF-calves were treated similarly, but the calves were fed colostrum with rotavirus antibodies during the first 48 h of life. These calves excreted passively acquired IgG1 and IgG2 rotavirus antibodies in their faeces from 2 to 6 days after birth. After vaccination, no IgM or IgA antibody activity in serum or faeces was detectable. Upon challenge, all calves developed diarrhoea and excreted rotavirus. Seven to 10 days after challenge low levels of IgM rotavirus antibody were detected for a short period. These data indicate that the intestinal antibody response of young calves to an enteric viral infection is associated with the excretion of IgM antibodies, immediately followed by IgA antibodies. This response is absent or diminished in calves with passively acquired specific antibodies which may explain the failure to induce a protective intestinal immune response by oral vaccination with modified live rotavirus of calves fed colostrum containing rotavirus antibodies.",1/31/1986,"Van Zaane, Dick; Ijzerman, Johan; De Leeuw, Peter W.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-2427(86)90087-5

Radiolabelled immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-DNP antibody was administered to 2 day old calves by intravenous injection. The serum clearance rate was measured and was compared to the rate of protein-bound 125I excretion in the feces over a 10 day period to determine the importance of transfer to the gastrointestinal tract as a mechanism of serum IgG1 clearance. The amount of protein-bound and DNP-binding 125I present in the gastrointestinal tract of 10 day old calves at necropsy was also measured. Fecal excretion of protein-bound 125I accounted for 32% of the serum 125I-IgG1 clearance. Protein-bound 125I was present in the gastrointestinal tract at necropsy in amounts estimated to account for 68% of the total 125I-IgG1 clearance, and retained 65% of the DNP-binding ability of the original antibody. The discrepancy between the fecal excretion (32% of total IgG1 clearance) and the GI clearance estimated from protein-bound 125I in the gut (68% of total IgG1 clearance) is explained in part by IgG1 proteolysis occurring after transfer to the gastrointestinal tract but before fecal excretion. These results indicate that transfer to the calf gastrointestinal tract accounts for most IgG1 clearance in young calves, and that the intestinal antibody retains antigen binding function and may contribute to intestinal immunity.",12/31/1987,"Besser, T.E.; McGuire, T.C.; Gay, C.C.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-2427(87)90126-7

Shedding of virus in nasal or fecal samples, and virus-infected nasal epithelial cells were detected using immunofluorescent staining (IF), ELISA or immune electron microscopy (IEM). Isotype-specific antibody titers in sera, nasal and fecal samples were determined by ELISA. Calves inoculated with coronavirus shed virus in feces and virus was detected in nasal epithelial cells. Nasal shedding persisted longer in IN-inoculated calves than in O-inoculated calves and longer than fecal shedding in both IN and O-inoculated calves. Diarrhea occurred in all calves, but there were no signs of respiratory disease. Calves inoculated with rotavirus had similar patterns of diarrhea and fecal shedding, but generally of shorter duration than in coronavirus-inoculated calves. No nasal shedding of rotavirus was detected. Peak IgM antibody responess, in most calves, were detected in fecal and nasal speciments at 7–10 days post-exposure (DPE), preceeding peak IgA responses which occurred at 10–14 DPE. The nasal antibody responses occurred in all virus-inoculated calves even in the absence of nasal shedding of virus in rotavirus-inoculated calves. Calves inoculated with coronavirus had higher titers of IgM and IgA antibodies in fecal and nasal samples than rotavirus-inoculated calves. In most inoculated calves, maximal titers of IgM or IgA antibodies correlated with the cessation of fecal or nasal virus shedding.

Four of the nine previously challenge-exposed cats were negative for virus-neutralizing antibodies against FIPV at the time of intradermal (ID) testing for DTH. Two other cats tested for DTH when acutely ill with clinical FIP did not have cutaneous DTH responses to FIPV. Gross skin reactions to FIPV injected ID were observed in six of nine asymptomatic cats (67%) at postintradermal inoculation hours (PIH) 24, 48, and/or 72. The reactions consisted of focal, 1–5-mm to 2.5-cm diameter indurated or semi-firm, nonerythematous, slightly raised nodules. Microscopically, DTH-like reactions were observed in biopsies taken from the FIPV-inoculated skin of asymptomatic cats at PIH 24 to 72. The lesions consisted of perivascular and diffuse dermal infiltrations by macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The dermal infiltrates, which were maximal at PIH 48 or 72, were predominantly mixed inflammatory cells (five of nine cats) or PMN (four of nine cats) at PIH 24, but later were predominantly mononuclear cells (six of nine cats) or mixed inflammatory cells (two of nine cats) at PIH 72. Five of nine cats (56%) with positive DTH skin responses had increased survival times after lethal ID challenge-exposure with FIPV compared to mean survival times in FIPV-naive, non-immune control cats that were DTH-negative when ID challenge-exposed. Four of nine DTH-positive cats (44%) resisted an ID challenge-exposure dose of FIPV that was fatal in both control cats, and two of the four remaining DTH-positive cats survived a third challenge-exposure with highly lethal doses of FIPV given intraperitoneally. Four of the six DTH-positive cats (67%) that died after re-challenge and were necropsied had lesions of noneffusive FIP, suggesting that cellular immunity may also be involved in the pathogenesis of noneffusive disease, whereas both control cats and both DTH-negative cats with clinical disease succumbed to effusive FIP.

Three-quarters of the cats with persistent FeLV infections died of non-neoplastic diseases and about 23% died of tumors, nearly exclusively those of the leukemia/lymphoma disease complex. A strong association with liver degeneration, icterus and a FeLV-associated enteritis was found in addition to the known association with non-neoplastic diseases and conditions such as anemia, bacterial secondary infections and respiratory tract inflammations due to the immunosuppressive effect of FeLV, hemorrhages and feline infectious peritonitis. Surprisingly, diseases and conditions like feline infectious panleukopenia, enteritis (of other types than FeLV-associated enteritis and feline infectious panleukopenia), glomerulonephritis, uremia and hemorrhagic cystitis were not associated with persistent FeLV infection.

Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 104 or 103 International Units (U) of rHuIFN-α for 24 h significantly suppressed (P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10–10−3 U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 104–102 U (P<0.001) or 10 U (P<0.05) of rHuIFN-α/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-3H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-α doses of 104 U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-α in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose (106 U/kg), moderate dose (104 U/kg), or a relatively low dose (102 U/kg) of rHuIFN-α. Cats inoculated with 106 U ofrHuIFN-α/kg had significantly reduced (P=0.037) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 104 or 102 U of rHuIFN-α/kg significantly enhanced (P=0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses.

To establish a foundation for evaluation of the immune function, cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated by a panel of six mitogens, and responses compared with those of domestic cat PBM. Individual responses in both species were variable, but evenly distributed throughout the range of stimulation for each mitogen. Proliferation by PBM from domestic cats occured within the same range as that of the cheetahs. However, a significantly lower response to peanut agglutinin (PNA) was observed with domestic cat PBM. Although responses varied between animals, certain individual cheetahs were consistent responders. The decreased values could not be explained by lack of IL-2 responsiveness since exogenous IL-2 significantly enhanced mitogen-stimulated proliferation in 11 of 12 cheetahs tested. The phenotypic distribution of domestic cat and cheetah lymphocyte subpopulations was similar as assessed by immunofluorescence staining for surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and cytotoxic T (Tc) cells (using a specific monoclonal antibody, FT2). Values for B cells (31.2% sIg+) and Tc (28.7% FT2 +) were slightly higher in domestic cats as compared with cheetah PBM (13.3% sIg+; 19.0% FT2+). Even though no species-specific deficits were detected, a significant negative correlation between PHA-stimulated proliferation and percent FT2+ (Tc) cheetah cells was observed. This indicates that proliferation can be used indirectly to assess relative numbers of functional T helper cells in cheetahs. Our studies suggest that these aspects of the cheetah's immune system are comparable with the domestic cat, and establish a basis for in vitro assays evaluating antigen-specific responses.",7/31/1991,"Miller-Edge, M.; Worley, M.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-2427(91)90125-v

Calves were then infected with a virulent rotavirus inoculum, J-160, to investigate the role of immune responses both in recovery from primary rotavirus infection and in resistance to secondary rotavirus infection. Treatment of calves with DX markedly suppressed in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens within 48 h of the start of DX treatment. Suppression was similar in rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune calves. In contrast, the effect of DX treatment on specific antibody responses differed depending on when DX treatment started in relation to rotavirus infection. When DX treatment commenced prior to primary rotavirus infection both systemic and local specific antibody responses were inhibited. These calves, in which mitogen and antibody responses were suppressed, exhibited greater clinical signs than did control calves after infection with virulent rotavirus, but virus excretion was affected in only one of the two calves. When DX treatment was started after primary rotavirus infection but before secondary infection, systemic and local antibody responses to the primary infection and to the challenge infection were not affected. These calves resisted challenge with virulent virus as did DX-untreated rotavirus-immune calves, even though mitogen responses were suppressed. We conclude that in a primary rotavirus infection, virus excretion ceased when both antibody and mitogen responses were suppressed. Resistance to secondary rotavirus infection occurred when mitogen responsiveness was suppressed, but when antibody levels were normal. Thus, no evidence was obtained that fully functional cell-mediated immune mechanisms are essential for resistance to rotavirus infection. Evidence was provided for the ability of parenteral treatment with DX to suppress mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.",4/30/1992,"Oldham, G.; Bridger, J.C.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-2427(92)90070-7

Clinically all cats developed generalised lymphadenopathy, six cats were neutropenic and five cats lymphopenic. Three cats became febrile with conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis and one of these cats ultimately developed jaundice. Postmortem examinations confirmed a generalised lymphadenopathy involving peripheral and visceral lymph nodes with concurrent stimulation of splenic white matter and mucosal lymphoid tissue of the digestive tract and conjunctiva. Within the lymph nodes there was a reactive follicular hyperplasia accompanied by a paracortical hyperplasia with an increased paracortical vascularity. Unusual features were the presence of lymphoid follicles in the bone marrow, thymus and parathyroid tissue. In addition, aggregates of lymphoid cells were found within salivary glands, kidneys, sclera and choroid of the eye.

Responses to all three mitogens were suppressed to a similar degree. Analysis of the circulating mononuclear cell sub-populations before and during DM treatment demonstrated a selective depletion of B cells; the T lymphocyte sub-population that expresses the gamma/delta form of T cell receptor, are CD2−, CD5+, CD8−, CD4− and constitute a major population in peripheral blood of calves. In vitro studies in gnotobiotic and conventional calves confirmed that DM was highly inhibitory for PHA responses but, in contrast to the in vivo findings, showed little effect of DM on ConA responses. Expression of surface antigens after 72 h in vitro culture in the presence of DM were little affected with the exception of BoCD8 and MHC II, which showed increased and decreased expression, respectively.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated with two strains of UV-inactivated FHV-1, whole heat-killed organisms or capsular antigen of Cryptococcus neoformans, and proliferative responses measured. As a group, cheetah PBM responded significantly poorer than domestic cat PBM when cultured with FHV-1. However, individual cheetah responses varied widely. Supplementation of cultures with exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) significantly increased the level of response of individual cheetahs to both strains of FHV-1. Cheetah sera contained slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers to FHV-1 than did domestic cat sera, suggesting that B cells function adequately in cheetahs. When stimulated with Cryptococcus neoformans, both species had similar incidences of positive proliferative responses. These data demonstrate that cheetahs exhibit heterogeneous responses to specific antigens, similar to domestic cats. However, a lower group response to FHV-1 in cheetahs suggests species differences occur. In addition, level of variability in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like genes, as determined by Southern blot hybridization, does not appear to correlate with a uniform response in in vitro functional assays.

Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC occurred by post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and numbers peaked in spleen and MLN tissues by PID 7 and in intestinal LP by PID 7–14. Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA and IgG ASC in these tissues peaked at PID 14–21. Rotavirus specific IgA ASC were predominant in the gut and IgA to IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios were highest for all rotavirus antigen coatings in the gut LP. However, the relative ratios of specific IgA to IgG ASC were lower (ratios of 5 to 7) against combined structural and nonstructural viral antigens (rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates) than ratios (13 to 46) against only viral structural antigens (rotavirus-coated ELISPOT plates), indicating that there were proportionately more specific IgG ASC to the nonstructural viral antigens in the LP, the tissue adjacent to the site of rotavirus replication in the intestine. In the node cells (spleen and MLN) rotavirus-specific IgA to IgG ASC ratios were lowest and against the various ELISPOT rotavirus coatings ranged from 0.7 to 4. Gnotobiotic piglets inoculated at different ages with porcine rotaviruses generally showed similar specific immunoglobulin (Ig) ASC responses to rotavirus infection, along with similar diarrhea and virus shedding patterns in the different age groups. However, the numbers of specific IgA ASC in the MLN of 3–4 week old pigs were higher than those of 3–5 day old pigs. Although challenge of SB1A or Gottfried rotavirus-inoculated pigs with SB1A (G4P7) or Gottfried (G4P6) rotavirus revealed a high degree of protection from diarrhea and virus shedding, greater numbers of specific IgM ASC were observed in spleen after challenge of SB1A-inoculated pigs with Gottfried rotavirus (same G type, distinct P type). Thus, by using the ELISPOT technique, we successfully measured intestinal mucosal antibody-related responses to rotavirus in gnotobiotic pigs.

Whether these are predominantly associated with particular Ig subclasses and (or) dietary proteins remains unclear. Therefore, antibody responses to soyabean protein were analysed by dot- and blot-immunobinding in plasma and intestinal mucous secretions. One-month-old calves were fed for 2.5 months liquid diets based on skim milk powder (SMP) or a mixture (2:3, protein basis) of whey and soyabean products including a low antigenic hydrolysed soya protein isolate (HSPI) and a highly antigenic heated soya flour (HSF). Specific antibodies (Abs) of the main isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2) were characterised by immunostaining of samples which had been previously incubated with nitrocellulose sheets coated with SMP, HSPI or HSF extracts. Plasma collected before feeding experimental diets showed very little specific Abs. By contrast, 2.5 month later, a three-fold increase (P < 0.05) in IgG1 and IgA titres against HSF antigens was observed in calves fed HSF compared with those fed the control or HSPI diet. IgG1 immunoblotting revealed many protein bands from soya in the molecular range of 22–32 and 38–42 kDa. Immunorecognition of specific proteins from SMP and HSPI remained low and similar among animal groups. Specific IgM, IgA and IgG1 titres against HSF, and to a lesser extent HSPI, were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in jejunal mucous secretion of calves fed HSF compared with other groups. Secretions from calves fed HSF bound to many soyabean proteins in the range of 17–23 and 26–38 kDa, with similar patterns for IgA and IgG1. By contrast, only weak bands were found for IgM and IgG2 in all groups of calves. Thus, calves fed antigenic HSF do present specific Abs including IgG1 and IgA isotypes, both systemically and locally. Therefore, IgG1 and (or) IgA rather than IgM and IgG2 Abs may be preferred for assessing the immunogenicity of soyabean products in calves.

PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibited less rectal virus shedding than suckling pigs. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses (> 96 000 counts per minute (cpm)) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric (MLN) and bronchial (BLN) lymph nodes of TGEV-primed pigs. Analyses of these responses indicate that virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses correlated with protection against rectal and nasal virus shedding after TGEV challenge. Primary inoculation of 11-day-old pigs with PRCV induced moderate, transient virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation (> 47 000 cpm) in MLN from both suckling and weaned pigs after TGEV challenge. Substantial BLN proliferative responses (> 80 000 cpm) correlated with failure to detect TGEV in nasal secretions from these pigs. Virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation in spleens was delayed in onset and of lower magnitude than that observed in MLN and BLN. Virulent TGEV exposure resulted in increased percentages of T cell subsets, especially in the lamina propria and MLN, mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues in proximity to the primary replication site of TGEV in the small intestine. Our results confirm that PRCV infection primes anti-viral immune responses and, thus, contributes to partial immunity against virulent TGEV challenge.",9/30/1995,"Brim, Theresa A.; VanCott, John L.; Lunney, Joan K.; Saif, Linda J.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-2427(94)05416-p

At the same time, in order to specify the effects of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the immune system, one half of the cats (n = 15) were previously infected with the Swiss isolate FIV Zurich 2. The second half of the animals (n = 15) served as non-infected controls. Eighteen (nine FIV-negative, nine FIV-positive) vaccinated and 12 (six FIV-negative, six FIV-positive) non-vaccinated cats were intraperitoneally challenged with FeLV A. Seventeen of 18 vaccinated cats were protected against persistent viremia, while ten of 12 non-vaccinated controls became infected. An increase of antibodies against FeLV SU was found in all protected cats after the challenge exposure. No difference in vaccine efficacy was found between FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals. The whole group of cats was observed for over 3 years. There were no further vaccinations during this period. CD4+ and CD8+ cell subsets, clinical outcome and time of survival of the cats were recorded. FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals were kept in two different rooms. However, FeLV-negative and FeLV viremic cats were housed together in both rooms in order to imitate a natural FeLV exposure situation. Anti-recombinant FeLV SU antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although a continuous decline of antibodies was found in FeLV vaccinated cats, they remained protected against constant FeLV challenge for over 3 years. FIV infection had a stronger effect on the depression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio than FeLV infection. Within the group of FIV-positive cats, the FeLV-vaccinated animals had significantly better survival rates as well as better clinical and laboratory parameters. FIV- and FeLV-coinfected cats showed the lowest CD4+:CD8+ ratio, mainly caused by decreased CD4+ lymphocyte counts. CD8+ lymphocytes with strong fluorescence (CD8high) disappeared and cells with weak fluorescence (CD8low) appeared instead. Prevention of coinfection by immunizing FIV-positive cats against FeLV infection improved the clinical outcome and prolonged the cat's life expectancy.",5/31/1995,"Hofmann-Lehmann, R.; Holznagel, E.; Aubert, A.; Ossent, P.; Reinacher, M.; Lutz, H.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-2427(94)07012-v

The piglets were the offspring from 12 sires and 31 dams. Data from an earlier experiment, including 96 piglets of seven sires and 24 dams, were added when estimating heritabilities for Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The highest heritability (h 2=0.87±0.41) was estimated for the total number of PMNL. Medium high heritabilities (h 2=0.3−0.4) were estimated for the phagocytic capacity of PMNL, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production and the total number of WBC, while the heritability estimates were lower (h 2=0.00−0.08±0.12) for the total number of lymphocytes, serum concentrations of Ig and IFN-α production. Pronounced differences between litters from various dams were found for total number of lymphocytes, IFN-α production, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The Con A induced proliferation was positively correlated (r=0.48, P<0.001) with the IL-2 production and both these parameters were correlated (r=0.44 and 0.37, respectively, P<0.001) to the virus induced IFN-α production.

Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-α (IFN-α) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-α-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC.

Humoral immune responses were assessed by enumerating specific antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT and by titrating immunoglobulins secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA techniques. Optimal secondary antibody response was observed from cultures performed with fetal calf serum (compared with horse serum) and with an antigen concentration of one to ten bacteria per cell. This kind of antigenic stimulation allowed induction of numerous antibody-secreting cells without adsorption of the secreted antibodies. Maximal numbers of antibody-secreting cells could reach a rate of 1% of the sheep leucocytes initially put into culture. Kinetic profiles of antibody production from boosted lymph node cells were characterized by an ascending phase from the sixth to the twelfth day of culture and then showed a plateau phase until Day 14. Most of the responses were composed of IgM and IgG1 antibodies, traces of IgG2 being detected at the end of experiments. From the twelfth day of antigenic stimulation, the IgM isotype was preferentially expressed with high antigen concentration (100 bacteria per cell), whereas the highest amounts of IgG1 were detected at lower concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell). While anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly specific for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell wall fraction, some IgG1 recognized other bacterial antigens. Kinetic profiles and magnitudes of primary antibody responses induced in vitro from lamb lymph node cells did not differ from those defined in cultures of sheep boosted leucocytes. But these immune reactions were mainly made up of anti-LPS IgM. Few anti-Salmonella IgG1 were detected from the tenth day of culture. So these in vitro assays allowed induction of an antibody synthesis from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node leucocytes. This methodology would permit achievement of more detailed studies on interactions between Salmonella and lymph node leucocytes, leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling bacterial dissemination through the lymphoid tissue.",6/30/1994,"Berthon, P.; Gohin, I.; Lantier, I.; Olivier, M.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-2427(94)90102-3

The initial concept of an enteromammary immunologic axis in monogastrics originated from studies of lactogenic immunity to TGEV in swine. These studies revealed that infection of pregnant swine with virulent TGEV stimulated high titers of SIgA antibodies in milk which correlated with protection of suckling pigs against TGE; parenteral or oral inoculation with live attenuated or killed TGEV vaccines induced mainly IgG antibodies in milk which generally provided poor protection to suckling pigs. The recent appearance of PRCV infections in swine and continuing studies of TGEV infections, present a unique model for further studies of mucosal immunity. Research using these viruses has increased our understanding of the various components of the common mucosal immune system and their interactions. Although the most important consideration in designing an effective vaccine for TGEV is the stimulation of GALT through intestinal virus replication, studies addressing the contribution of BALT to immunity to TGEV and PRCV may provide insights for alternative vaccine approaches. The mechanism by which exposure to PRCV elicits a variable degree of immunity to TGEV challenge is unknown. Virus replication in the gut or respiratory tract is a major factor affecting the magnitude of the immune response at the respective site and may be necessary for the recruitment of specific immune cells from other mucosal inductive sites, i.e., GALT to BALT and BALT to GALT migration. Further studies on the induction and immune regulation of specific responses to TGEV and PRCV that affect the distribution patterns of IgM-, IgG- and IgA-antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and T lymphocytes should provide valuable insights for optimizing vaccine regimens to elicit the highest mucosal immune responses and optimal protection against TGEV challenge.",10/31/1994,"Saif, L.J.; van Cott, J.L.; Brim, T.A.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-2427(94)90124-4

In order to determine the effects of multiple vaccination schedules on the immune system of racing greyhounds, three litters of greyhound pups raised in laboratory conditions were divided into two groups and subjected to either a maximum or a minimum vaccination schedule. Blood samples were collected biweekly for 6 months beginning at 2 weeks of age and analyzed to establish ‘baseline’ values for the lymphatic system of greyhounds. Lymphocyte transformation, total and differential leukocyte counts, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cellular immunity. Humoral immunity was evaluated using serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) was higher for the maximum vaccination groups. The frequency distribution of circulating CD4 and IgG labeled lymphocytes was higher in the minimum vaccination groups. A significant treatment by time interaction in CD4, IgG, and IgM labeled cells was observed. This interaction, however, was not significant at any point in time for CD4 and IgG labeled cells. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing surface IgM was significantly higher in the minimum vaccination groups at 10 and 14 weeks of age.

The acute phase response is comprised of reactions localized at the site of infection, as well as the initiation of systemic responses, which include a rapid increase in the serum concentration of some proteins, known as acute phase proteins (APP). Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected two APP of approximately 22 and 37 kDa molecular weight in sera obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Based on their presence in the sera of sick, but not normal animals, the molecular weights, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and the ability to bind hemoglobin, we identified these proteins as the α and β subunits of haptoglobin. The haptoglobin molecule and the α subunit were isolated from serum, purified, and used to produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. With these reagents, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure the concentration of haptoglobin in bovine serum. Using an experimental model of BRD induced by a sequential challenge of calves with bovine herpesvirus type-1 and Pasteurella haemolytica, we observed a temporal relationship between the increase in haptoglobin concentration in serum and the onset of bacterial infection. The haptoglobin concentration ranged from undetectable in the serum of most calves prior to challenge, to greater than 1 mgml−1 in over one-third of the calves at the height of disease. Furthermore, the concentration of haptoglobin was associated significantly with other measures of the severity of disease. Together, these results indicate that quantification of acute phase proteins in animals with BRD could be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic aid.",6/1/1996,"Godson, Dale L.; Campos, Manuel; Attah-Poku, Samuel K.; Redmond, Mark J.; Cordeiro, Daphne M.; Sethi, Manjeet S.; Harland, Richard J.; Babiuk, Lorne A.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,TRUE,FALSE,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-2427(95)05520-7

Possible antiviral mechanisms of macrophages are defined and referred to as intrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to serve as a non-permissive barrier between the virus and susceptible cells and extrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to affect the virus or virus replication in surrounding cells. Most studies on the role of macrophages in natural resistance to virus infections have been performed in animal models. An interesting aspect of many viral infections in animals is the finding of a genetically determined variation in natural resistance. Because of the availability of numerous inbred and congenic strains most studies on genetically determined resistance have been performed in mice. The classical examples are resistance to flaviviruses and susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus, both of which are inherited as dominant, monogenic traits. With these viruses macrophage intrinsic restriction of virus replication has been found to express at the cellular level the genetics of resistance/susceptibility seen in the intact animal. Other examples, where macrophages have been implicated in genetically determined resistance include herpes simplex virus and influenza virus.

In addition, IFN-α SC could be detected in the cord blood, the spleen and the bone marrow of fetuses at later stages of gestation.

Neurological symptoms were associated with marked lesions of primary demyelination in the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS), and developing after an incubation time of several weeks to months. Many rats survived this infection and recovered completely from this CNS disease. Among 43 survivors of SDE, 9 rats developed a relapse 27–153 days after onset of the first attack. Neuropathological examination of these animals revealed areas of fresh demyelination together with old remyelinated lesions. Viral antigens were detectable in the neighbourhood of fresh lesions and in some cases infectious virus was re-isolated from rats revealing low antibody titers to JHM virus.

JHM virus, LPS and AP are all capable of inducing Ia molecules on astrocytes, however, in a pattern and kinetics distinct from recombinant rat gamma interferon (γ-IFN). Whereas γ-IFN induced Ia expression on astrocytes and all macrophages after 48 h treatment, JHM virus, LPS and AP required 4–7 days for maximal induction of Ia on astrocytes, but had little to no effect on the macrophage population. This indicates that astrocytes are uniquely reactive to components derived from infectious agents and that these components are immunoregulatory with respect to Ia expression on astrocytes. We have also attempted to determine possible mechanisms by which these agents induce astrocyte Ia and show that phorbol myristate acetate and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 have similar effects.

These observations raise the possibility that the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the CNS may play a critical role in survival from a lethal CNS infection. Transient DTH response to nonviral antigens induced an accumulation of monocytes in the CNS that was maximal at 48 h post-challenge and virtually resolved by 5 days post-challenge. By contrast the induction of prolonged DTH responses resulted in the accumulation of a large number monocytes that persisted in the CNS for at least 5 days post-challenge.

The disease is characterized pathologically by an intense inflammatory infiltration within both the white and grey matter of the central nervous system (CNS) without apparent demyelination. Both during and after SAME splenic lymphocytes from these animals could be restimulated in vitro to proliferate in the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP). MBP-specific class II MHC-restricted T cell lines were isolated from this cell population. They were shown to exhibit no cross-reactivity with measles virus and to induce experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in naive syngeneic recipients following adoptive transfer. The clinical and histopathological signs of this T cell-mediated disease were identical to that seen in classical T cell-mediated EAE. A humoral immune response to MBP was only detected in a limited number of those rats with SAME.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), however, as in endocrine autoimmune diseases, there is a marked increase of HLA expression in the tissue (i.e. the plaques) and this is attributable not only to infiltrating cells but also to the astrocytes. To gain an insight into the regulation of HLA in the different cell types in the CNS and to compare it to that observed in the endocrine organs, we have studied the effect of the lympho/monokines interferon (IFN)-α and -γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-2 and other agents on this aspect of the biology of human fetal brain cells in culture. A two-colour immunofluorescence technique which combines antibodies to diverse CNS cell markers and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to the non-polymorphic region of HLA molecules was used throughout this study. In control cultures, only astrocytes expressed MHC class I, but after incubation with either IFN-γ or TNF-α oligodendrocytes acquired class I expression. Surprisingly, astrocytes became spontaneously class II positive in culture and this was greatly enhanced by IFN-γ. Other agents such as IL-2, epidermal growth factor, phorbolmyristate acetate and lectins had no effect. The expression of HLA molecules in the cells of the CNS both in basal conditions and in response to lymphokines is therefore selective and highly heterogenous, thus reflecting their intrinsic biological diversity.
